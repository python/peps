Abstract
========

This PEP outlines the steps required to migrate Python's issue tracker
from Roundup to using GitHub Issues.


Rationale
=========

CPython's development moved to GitHub on February 2017. All other projects within
The PSF's organization are hosted on GitHub and are using GitHub issues.
CPython is still using Roundup as the issue tracker in bugs.python.org (bpo) [1]_.

Why GitHub
----------

GitHub has a lot of nice features readily available out of the box, that are not
currently available in Roundup / bpo.

- APIs we can use to build integrations and automations. There are various existing
  integrations and applications available from GitHub Marketplace to help with
  our workflow. New applications are easily installed and enabled.

- Ability to embed screenshots and files in pull requests and issues.

- Administrators and core developers can edit issues comments and pull requests.

- Ability to reply to issues and pull request conversations via email.

- It supports two factor authentication.

- It supports markdown and emoji. It has a preview tab, so we can see how our
  comment will be rendered, before actually posting.

- It supports voting (reactions).

- It supports permalink [2]_, allowing us to quote and copy paste
  source code easily.

- Core developers don't have to maintain it, giving us more time to focus on
  the development of Python.

- We can automatically close issues when a PR has been merged [3]_.

- With more than 28 million users, an open source contributor is more likely
  to already have an account, and familiar with GitHub interface, making it
  easier to start contributing.

- Email notifications contain metadata [4]_, integrated with GMail, and
  allows you to systematically filter emails.

- Email address can remain hidden by choice.


Issues with bpo / Roundup
-------------------------

- Less than five people maintain bpo. Some of them are core developers.

- It is in Mercurial. Without any CI available, it puts heavy burden on existing
  (few) maintainers in terms of reviewing, testing, and applying patches.

- At its current state, it is not equipped to accept lots of contributions from
  people who aren't already familiar with the code base.

- The upstream Roundup is in Mercurial. There is an open discussion about
  moving the source code of bpo to GitHub [5]_. If the source code of
  bpo does move to GitHub, it will become difficult to update patches from
  upstream. But as long as it is in Mercurial, it is be difficult to maintain
  and onboard new contributors.

- The user interface needs update and redesign. It will require UX/UI research
  to keep it up to date with current web standards.

- Email address is exposed. There is no choice to mask it.

- There is no REST API available. There is an open issue in Roundup for adding
  REST API  [6]_. Last activity was in 2016.

- It sends a number of unnecessary emails and notifications, and it is difficult,
  if not impossible, to configure. An example is the nosy email, where we get
  email notification whenever someone added themselves as "nosy".
  An issue has been filed in upstream Roundup about this since 2012 with
  little traction [7]_.

- Creating an account has been a hassle. We've had reports when people have
  trouble creating accounts or logging in.

Why not GitLab
--------------

Had we migrated to GitLab instead of GitHub in 2017, this PEP would have been
titled "Using GitLab Issues for CPython".

Why not other issue tracker
---------------------------

Using another issue tracker will require yet another learning curve, of having
to learn and get used to a different interface. We'll also need to learn and
figure out how to build the integrations with GitHub.

By using GitHub issues, where the source code is currently hosted, where pull
requests are taking place, we'll be providing consistent experience to contributors
and maintainers, and not having to jump from one interface to another.

If someone else wants to do the research of what it takes for Python to start
using other issue tracker, and what the migration plan is, please go ahead and
come back with a PEP.

Why not focus on improving Roundup / bpo
----------------------------------------

GitHub has many features we like that are already available. We still need to
build out additional integrations and update our bots, but this is something
we already know how to do.

In order to really improve Roundup / bpo, it needs to first migrate to GitHub,
add CI and bots. As I understand it, there is hesitation because upstream Roundup
is still im Mercurial. Someone more familiar with Roundup / bpo needs
to champion this effort. (I'm not volunteering, I'm sorry).

I believe the effort of creating and maintaining GitHub integrations and bots
is much less than the effort needed to get Roundup up to speed and then to continue
maintaining it.

Migration Plan
==============

Backup of GitHub data
---------------------

This effort has been started and being tracked as an issue in core-workflow
[8]_. We're using GitHub Migrations API [9]_
to download GitHub data for CPython on daily basis. The archives will be
dropped in an S3 bucket.

Thanks to Ernest W. Durbin III for working on this.

Update the CLA host
-------------------

At the moment the CLA is hosted within bpo. It needs to be updated such that
signing the CLA does not require a bpo account, and it should be hosted outside
of the bpo.

The current CLA process itself is not ideal. Currently contributors to
devguide, peps, and core-workflow need to sign a CLA,  and it requires a bpo
account. A bpo account should not be required for those projects.

Currently the CLA process involves real human to manually check the records.
Question: Will it be possible to completely automate the CLA process, so
it does not require human intervention?

Create labels for issue triage
------------------------------

In bpo, we currently have the following fields for each issues:

Type: behavior, crash, compile error, resource usage, security, performance, enhancement.
Components: 2to3, Argument Clinic, asyncio, Build, Cross-build, ctypes, ...
Priority: release blocker, deferred blocker, critical, high, normal, low

We will create the corresponding labels::

   type-behavior, type-crash, type-compile error, type-resource usage, ...

   components-2to3, components-argument clinic, components-asyncio, ...

   priority-release blocker, priority-deferred blocker, priority-critical, ...

In addition, we'll create ``needs triage`` label.

Create issue template
---------------------

We will create an issue template and add the following headers::

   ---
   Type: behavior | crash | compile error | resource usage (choose one)
   Components: 2to3 | Argument Clinic | asyncio | Build | ... (can select more than one)
   Priority: release blocker | deferred blocker | critical | ...
   Needs backport to: 2.7 | 3.6 | 3.7
   ---

The idea is to allow the issue creator to help us triage the issue.
The above values are pre-filled in the template. Issue creator will remove texts
that do not apply to their issue.

Based on the above headers, bedevere-bot can apply the necessary labels to the
issue. If issue creator did not supply the above headers, the bot will apply
``needs triage`` label. At that point it will require a core developer to
properly label the issue.

Updates to bedevere
-------------------

Bedevere-bot will need to be updated to recognize the issue headers described above,
and apply the proper labels.

Bedevere-bot can also copy over the labels to pull requests that correspond to
the issue.

Update the devguide
-------------------

Provide explanation in the devguide about new issue workflow and triage labels.

Add a button in bpo to migrate the issue to GitHub
--------------------------------------------------

This will require actual update to the bpo. But I believe this effort needed
is much less than a complete overhaul.

We will create a button in bpo, that will copy over the issue description
and associated comments into a GitHub issue.

We should not be moving all open issues to GitHub. Issues with little or no
activity should just be closed. Issues with no decision made for years should
just be closed.

If a core developer is still interested in the issue, they can indicate so in
the bpo issue, and later use the button to migrate it over to GitHub.

Make bpo readonly
-----------------

This should be the final step. Once we start using GitHub issues, make bpo
readonly, not shut it down.
Do not accept new registrations. Do not allow comments or issues to be created.

TBD and additional concerns
===========================

Expert index
------------

At the moment, there is a mechanism to add people in expert index automatically
added to the nosy list. We need to replicate this functionality.

A GitHub account should not be a requirement
--------------------------------------------

Back when it was discussed about moving the CPython codebase from Mercurial
to GitHub [10]_ and [11]_, it was brought up that
we need to still allow uploading patches in bpo, and that a GitHub account should
not be a requirement in order to contribute to Python.

If bpo is made readonly, we'll need to come up with a different solution to allow
folks to contribute when they don't own a GitHub account.

One solution is to create a new "python-issues" mailing list, similar to
docs@python.org [12]_ mailing list, to allow people to submit their issues
there.

Related to this, since the migration to GitHub in 2017, I recall one case
[13]_ where we had one contributor who submitted patch to Mercurial, and
refused to create a GitHub account. Because of this, our bot is unable to detect
whether the have signed CLA. Another person had volunteered to upload his
patch to GitHub. But we still require both people to sign the CLA.

That particular situation was complicated. It took up five core developers time
to investigate and manually check the CLA, causing confusion.

Trim off the "Components" list
--------------------------

Is the current "components" list still making sense and relevant?
Can we shorten the list?

Priority list
-------------

Is the current "priority" list useful? Nick Coghlan noted that perhaps only
``release blocker`` and ``deferred blocker`` are useful.

Further questions and discussions
---------------------------------

Include ``#pep581`` in the subject when posting to python-dev.

There is a dedicated `#pep581 <https://python.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/130206-.23pep581>`_
stream in python.zulipchat.com.
