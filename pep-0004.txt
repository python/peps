Introduction
============

When new modules were added to the standard Python library in the
past, it was not possible to foresee whether they would still be
useful in the future.  Even though Python "Comes With Batteries
Included", batteries may discharge over time.  Carrying old modules
around is a burden on the maintainer, especially when there is no
interest in the module anymore.

At the same time, removing a module from the distribution is
difficult, as it is not known in general whether anybody is still
using it.  This PEP defines a procedure for removing modules from the
standard Python library.  Usage of a module may be 'deprecated', which
means that it may be removed from a future Python release.  The
rationale for deprecating a module is also collected in this PEP.  If
the rationale turns out faulty, the module may become 'undeprecated'.


Procedure for declaring a module deprecated
===========================================

Since the status of module deprecation is recorded in this PEP,
proposals for deprecating modules MUST be made by providing a change
to the text of this PEP, which SHOULD be a patch posted to
bugs.python.org.

A proposal for deprecation of the module MUST include the date of the
proposed deprecation and a rationale for deprecating it.  In addition,
the proposal MUST include a change to the documentation of the module;
deprecation is indicated by saying that the module is "obsolete" or
"deprecated".  The proposal SHOULD include a patch for the module's
source code to indicate deprecation there as well, by raising a
DeprecationWarning.  The proposal MUST include patches to remove any
use of the deprecated module from the standard library.

It is expected that deprecated modules are included in the Python
releases that immediately follows the deprecation; later releases may
ship without the deprecated modules.


Procedure for declaring a module undeprecated
=============================================

When a module becomes deprecated, a rationale is given for its
deprecation.  In some cases, an alternative interface for the same
functionality is provided, so the old interface is deprecated.  In
other cases, the need for having the functionality of the module may
not exist anymore.

If the rationale is faulty, again a change to this PEP's text MUST be
submitted.  This change MUST include the date of undeprecation and a
rationale for undeprecation.  Modules that are undeprecated under this
procedure MUST be listed in this PEP for at least one major release of
Python.


Obsolete modules
================

A number of modules are already listed as obsolete in the library
documentation.  These are listed here for completeness.

    cl, sv, timing

All these modules have been declared as obsolete in Python 2.0, some
even earlier.

The following obsolete modules were removed in Python 2.5:

    addpack, cmp, cmpcache, codehack, dircmp, dump, find, fmt,
    grep, lockfile, newdir, ni, packmail, Para, poly,
    rand, reconvert, regex, regsub, statcache, tb, tzparse,
    util, whatsound, whrandom, zmod

The following modules were removed in Python 2.6:

    gopherlib, rgbimg, macfs

The following modules currently lack a DeprecationWarning:

    rfc822, mimetools, multifile


Deprecated modules
==================

::

    Module name:   posixfile
    Rationale:     Locking is better done by fcntl.lockf().
    Date:          Before 1-Oct-2000.
    Documentation: Already documented as obsolete.  Deprecation
                   warning added in Python 2.6.

    Module name:   gopherlib
    Rationale:     The gopher protocol is not in active use anymore.
    Date:          1-Oct-2000.
    Documentation: Documented as deprecated since Python 2.5.  Removed
                   in Python 2.6.

    Module name:   rgbimgmodule
    Rationale:     In a 2001-04-24 c.l.py post, Jason Petrone mentions
                   that he occasionally uses it; no other references to
                   its use can be found as of 2003-11-19.
    Date:          1-Oct-2000
    Documentation: Documented as deprecated since Python 2.5.  Removed
                   in Python 2.6.

    Module name:   pre
    Rationale:     The underlying PCRE engine doesn't support Unicode, and
                   has been unmaintained since Python 1.5.2.
    Date:          10-Apr-2002
    Documentation: It was only mentioned as an implementation detail,
                   and never had a section of its own.   This mention
                   has now been removed.

    Module name:   whrandom
    Rationale:     The module's default seed computation was
                   inherently insecure; the random module should be
                   used instead.
    Date:          11-Apr-2002
    Documentation: This module has been documented as obsolete since
                   Python 2.1, but listing in this PEP was neglected.
                   The deprecation warning will be added to the module
                   one year after Python 2.3 is released, and the
                   module will be removed one year after that.

    Module name:   rfc822
    Rationale:     Supplanted by Python 2.2's email package.
    Date:          18-Mar-2002
    Documentation: Documented as "deprecated since release 2.3" since
                   Python 2.2.2.

    Module name:   mimetools
    Rationale:     Supplanted by Python 2.2's email package.
    Date:          18-Mar-2002
    Documentation: Documented as "deprecated since release 2.3" since
                   Python 2.2.2.

    Rationale:     Supplanted by Python 2.2's email package.
    Date:          18-Mar-2002
    Documentation: Documented as "deprecated since release 2.3" since
                   Python 2.2.2.  Raises a DeprecationWarning as of
                   Python 2.6.

    Module name:   mimify
    Rationale:     Supplanted by Python 2.2's email package.
    Date:          18-Mar-2002
    Documentation: Documented as "deprecated since release 2.3" since
                   Python 2.2.2.  Raises a DeprecationWarning as of
                   Python 2.6.

    Module name:   rotor
    Rationale:     Uses insecure algorithm.
    Date:          24-Apr-2003
    Documentation: The documentation has been removed from the library
                   reference in Python 2.4.

    Module name:   TERMIOS.py
    Rationale:     The constants in this file are now in the 'termios' module.
    Date:          10-Aug-2004
    Documentation: This module has been documented as obsolete since
                   Python 2.1, but listing in this PEP was neglected.
                   Removed from the library reference in Python 2.4.

    Module name:   statcache
    Rationale:     Using the cache can be fragile and error-prone;
                   applications should just use os.stat() directly.
    Date:          10-Aug-2004
    Documentation: This module has been documented as obsolete since
                   Python 2.2, but listing in this PEP was neglected.
                   Removed from the library reference in Python 2.5.

    Module name:   mpz
    Rationale:     Third-party packages provide similiar features

    Date:          10-Aug-2004
    Documentation: This module has been documented as obsolete since
                   Python 2.3, but listing in this PEP was neglected.
                   Removed from the library reference in Python 2.4.

    Date:          21-Feb-2006
    Documentation: Documented as deprecated as of Python 2.5.

    Module name:   sets
    Rationale:     The built-in set/frozenset types, introduced in
                   Python 2.4, supplant the module.
    Date:          12-Jan-2007

                   listing in this PEP was neglected.  A
                   DeprecationWarning was added in Python 2.6.

    Module name:   macfs
    Rationale:     Unknown.
    Date:          15-May-2007
    Documentation: Documented as deprecated as of Python 2.3, but

                   Remove from 2.7
    Documentation: None

    Module name:   formatter
    Rationale:     Lack of use in the community, no tests to keep

Deprecation of modules removed in Python 3.0
============================================

PEP 3108 lists all modules that have been removed from Python 3.0.
They all are documented as deprecated in Python 2.6, and raise a
DeprecationWarning if the -3 flag is activated.


Undeprecated modules
====================

None.
