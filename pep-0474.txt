Abstract
========

This PEP proposes setting up a new PSF provided resource, forge.python.org,
as a location for maintaining various supporting repositories
(such as the repository for Python Enhancement Proposals) in a way that is
more accessible to new contributors, and easier to manage for core
developers.

This PEP does *not* propose any changes to the core development workflow
for CPython itself (see PEP 462 in relation to that).


Proposal
========

This PEP proposes that an instance of the self-hosted Kallithea code
repository management system be deployed as "forge.python.org".

Individual repositories (such as the developer guide or the PEPs repository)
may then be migrated from the existing hg.python.org infrastructure to the
new forge.python.org infrastructure on a case by case basis. Each migration
will need to decide whether to retain a read-only mirror on hg.python.org,
or whether to just migrate wholesale to the new location.

In addition to supporting read-only mirrors on hg.python.org,
forge.python.org will also aim to support hosting mirrors on popular
proprietary hosting sites like GitHub and BitBucket. The aim will be to
allow users familiar with these sites to submit and discuss pull requests
using their preferred workflow, with forge.python.org automatically bringing
those contributions over to the master repository.

Given the availability and popularity of commercially backed "free for open
source projects" repository hosting services, this would not be a general
purpose hosting site for arbitrary Python projects. The initial focus will be
specifically on CPython and other repositories currently hosted on
hg.python.org. In the future, this could potentially be expanded to
consolidating other PSF managed repositories that are currently externally
hosted to gain access to a pull request based workflow, such as the
repository for the python.org Django application. As with the initial
migrations, any such future migrations would be considered on a case-by-case
basis, taking into account the preferences of the primary users of each
repository.


Rationale
=========

Currently, hg.python.org hosts more than just the core CPython repository,
it also hosts other repositories such as those for the CPython developer
guide and for Python Enhancement Proposals, along with various "sandbox"
repositories for core developer experimentation.

While the simple "pull request" style workflow made popular by code hosting
sites like GitHub and BitBucket isn't adequate for the complex branching
model needed for parallel maintenance and development of the various
CPython releases, it's a good fit for several of the ancillary projects
that surround CPython that we don't wish to move to a proprietary hosting
site.

The key requirements proposed for a PSF provided software forge are:

* MUST support simple "pull request" style workflows
* MUST support online editing for simple changes
* MUST be backed by an active development organisation (community or
  commercial)

Additional recommended requirements that are satisfied by this proposal,
but may be negotiable if a sufficiently compelling alternative is presented:

* SHOULD support self-hosting on PSF infrastructure without ongoing fees
* SHOULD be a fully open source application written in Python
* SHOULD support Mercurial (for consistency with existing tooling)
* SHOULD support Git (to provide that option to users that prefer it)
* SHOULD allow users of git and Mercurial clients to transparently
  collaborate on the same repository
* SHOULD be open to customisation to meet the needs of CPython core
  development, including providing a potential path forward for the
  proposed migration to a core reviewer model in PEP 462


The preference for self-hosting without ongoing fees rules out the
free-as-in-beer providers like GitHub and BitBucket, in addition to the
various proprietary source code management offerings.

The preference for Mercurial support not only rules out GitHub, but also
other Git-only solutions like GitLab and Gitorious.

The hard requirement for online editing support rules out the Apache
Allura/HgForge combination.

The preference for a fully open source solution rules out RhodeCode.

Of the various options considered by the author of this proposal, that
leaves `Kallithea SCM <https://kallithea-scm.org/>`__ as the proposed
foundation for a forge.python.org service.

Kallithea is a full GPLv3 application (derived from the clearly
and unambiguously GPLv3 licensed components of RhodeCode) that is being
developed under the auspices of the `Software Freedom Conservancy
<http://sfconservancy.org/news/2014/jul/04/kallithea-joins/>`__. The
Conservancy has `affirmed
<http://sfconservancy.org/blog/2014/jul/15/why-kallithea/>`__ that the
Kallithea codebase is completely and validly licensed under GPLv3. In
addition to their role in building the initial Kallithea community, the
Conservancy is also the legal home of both the Mercurial and Git projects.
Other SFC member projects that may be familiar to Python users include
Twisted, Gevent, BuildBot and PyPy.


Intended Benefits
==================

The primary benefit of deploying Kallithea as forge.python.org is that
supporting repositories such as the developer guide and the PEP repo could
potentially be managed using pull requests and online editing. This would be
much simpler than the current workflow which requires PEP editors and
other core developers to act as intermediaries to apply updates suggested
by other users.

The richer administrative functionality would also make it substantially
easier to grant users access to particular repositories for collaboration
purposes, without having to grant them general access to the entire
installation.


Sustaining Engineering Considerations
=====================================

Even with its current workflow, CPython itself remains one of the largest
open source projects in the world (in the
`top 2% <https://www.openhub.net/p/python/factoids#FactoidTeamSizeVeryLarge>`
of projects tracked on OpenHub). Unfortunately, we have been significantly
less effective at encouraging contributions to the projects that make up
CPython's workflow infrastructure, including ensuring that our installations
track upstream, and that wherever feasible, our own customisations are
contributed back to the original project.

As such, a core component of this proposal is to actively engage with the
upstream Kallithea community to lower the barriers to working with and on
the Kallithea SCM, as well as with the PSF Infrastructure team to ensure
the forge.python.org service integrates cleanly with the PSF's infrastructure
automation.

This approach aims to provide a number of key benefits:

* allowing those of us contributing to maintenance of this service to be
  as productive as possible in the time we have available
* offering a compelling professional development opportunity to those
  volunteers that choose to participate in maintenance of this service
* making the Kallithea project itself more attractive to other potential
  users by making it as easy as possible to adopt, deploy and manage
* as a result of the above benefits, attracting sufficient contributors both
  in the upstream Kallithea community, and within the CPython infrastructure
  community, to allow the forge.python.org service to evolve effectively to
  meet changing developer expectations

Some initial steps have already been taken to address these sustaining
engineering concerns:

* Tymoteusz Jankowski has been working with Donald Stufft to work out `what
  would be involved <https://github.com/xliiv/psf-salt/tree/kallithea>`__
  in deploying Kallithea using the PSF's Salt based infrastructure automation.
* Graham Dumpleton and I have been working on
  `making it easy
<http://www.curiousefficiency.org/posts/2014/12/kallithea-on-openshift.html>
`__ to deploy
  demonstration Kallithea instances to the free tier of Red Hat's open source
  hosting service, OpenShift Online. (See the comments on that post, or the
  `quickstart issue tracker
  <https://github.com/ncoghlan/openshift-kallithea/issues/>`__ for links to
  Graham's follow on work)

The next major step to be undertaken is to come up with a local development
workflow that allows contributors on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux to run
the Kallithea tests locally, without interfering with the operation of
their own system. The currently planned approach for this is to focus on
Vagrant, which is a popular automated virtual machine management system
specifically aimed at developers running local VMs for testing purposes.
The `Vagrant based development guidelines
<http://www.openshift.org/documentation/oo_deployment_guide_vagrant.html>`__
for
OpenShift Origin provide an extended example of the kind of workflow this
approach enables. It's also worth noting that Vagrant is one of the options
for working with a local build of the `main python.org website
<https://github.com/python/pythondotorg#using-vagrant>`__.

If these workflow proposals end up working well for Kallithea, they may also
be worth proposing for use by the upstream projects backing other PSF and
CPython infrastructure services, including Roundup, BuildBot, and the main
python.org web site.


Technical Concerns and Challenges
=================================

Introducing a new service into the CPython infrastructure presents a number
of interesting technical concerns and challenges. This section covers several
of the most significant ones.

User account management
-----------------------

Ideally we'd like to be able to offer a single account that spans all
python.org services, including Kallithea, Roundup/Rietveld, PyPI and the
back end for the new python.org site, but actually implementing that would
be a distinct infrastructure project, independent of this PEP.

For the initial rollout of forge.python.org, we will likely create yet another
identity silo within the PSF infrastructure. A potentially superior
alternative would be to add support for `python-social-auth
<https://python-social-auth.readthedocs.org>`__ to Kallithea, but actually
doing so would not be a requirement for the initial rollout of the service
(the main technical concern there is that Kallithea is a Pylons application
that has not yet been ported to Pyramid, so integration will require either
adding a Pylons backend to python-social-auth, or else embarking on the
Pyramid migration in Kallithea).


Breaking existing SSH access and links for Mercurial repositories
-----------------------------------------------------------------

This PEP proposes leaving the existing hg.python.org installation alone,
and setting up Kallithea on a new host. This approach minimises the risk
of interfering with the development of CPython itself (and any other
projects that don't migrate to the new software forge), but does make any
migrations of existing repos more disruptive (since existing checkouts will
break).


Integration with Roundup
------------------------

Kallithea provides configurable issue tracker integration. This will need
to be set up appropriately to integrate with the Roundup issue tracker at
bugs.python.org before the initial rollout of the forge.python.org service.


Accepting pull requests on GitHub and BitBucket
-----------------------------------------------

The initial rollout of forge.python.org would support publication of read-only
mirrors, both on hg.python.org and other services, as that is a relatively
straightforward operation that can be implemented in a commit hook.

While a highly desirable feature, accepting pull requests on external
services, and mirroring them as submissions to the master repositories on
forge.python.org is a more complex problem, and would likely not be included
as part of the initial rollout of the forge.python.org service.


Transparent Git and Mercurial interoperability
----------------------------------------------

Kallithea's native support for both Git and Mercurial offers an opportunity
to make it relatively straightforward for developers to use the client
of their choice to interact with repositories hosted on forge.python.org.

This transparent interoperability does *not* exist yet, but running our own
multi-VCS repository hosting service provides the opportunity to make this
capability a reality, rather than passively waiting for a proprietary
provider to deign to provide a feature that likely isn't in their commercial
interest. There's a significant misalignment of incentives between open
source communities and commercial providers in this particular area, as even
though offering VCS client choice can significantly reduce community friction
by eliminating the need for projects to make autocratic decisions that force
particular tooling choices on potential contributors, top down enforcement
of tool selection (regardless of developer preference) is currently still
the norm in the corporate and other organisational environments that produce
GitHub and Atlassian's paying customers.

Prior to acceptance, in the absence of transparent interoperability, this PEP
should propose specific recommendations for inclusion in the CPython
developer's guide for using git-hg to create pull requests against
forge.python.org hosted Mercurial repositories.


Future Implications for CPython Core Development
================================================

The workflow requirements for the main CPython development repository are
significantly more complex than those for the repositories being discussed
in this PEP. These concerns are covered in more detail in PEP 462.

Given Guido's recommendation to replace Reitveld with a more actively
maintained code review system, my current plan is to rewrite that PEP to
use Kallithea as the proposed glue layer, with enhanced Kallithea pull
requests eventually replacing the current practice of uploading patche files
directly to the issue tracker.

I've also started working with Pierre Yves-David on a `custom Mercurial
extension <https://bitbucket.org/ncoghlan/cpydev/src/default/cpyhg.py?at=default>`__
that automates some aspects of the CPython core development workflow.
