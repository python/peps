Abstract
========

This PEP lays out the theory referenced by PEP 484.


Introduction
============

This document lays out the theory of the new type hinting proposal for
Python 3.5. It's not quite a full proposal or specification because
there are many details that need to be worked out, but it lays out the
theory without which it is hard to discuss more detailed specifications.
We start by explaining gradual typing; then we state some conventions
and general rules; then we define the new special types (such as Union)
that can be used in annotations; and finally we define the approach to
generic types. (TODO: The latter section needs more fleshing out; sorry!)


Specification
=============


Summary of gradual typing
-------------------------

We define a new relationship, is-consistent-with, which is similar to
is-subclass-of, except it is not transitive when the new type **Any** is
involved. (Neither relationship is symmetric.) Assigning x to y is OK if
the type of x is consistent with the type of y. (Compare this to "... if
the type of x is a subclass of the type of y," which states one of the
fundamentals of OO programming.) The is-consistent-with relationship is
defined by three rules:

-  A type t1 is consistent with a type t2 if t1 is a subclass of t2.
   (But not the other way around.)
-  **Any** is consistent with every type. (But **Any** is not a subclass
   of every type.)
-  Every type is a subclass of **Any**. (Which also makes every type
   consistent with **Any**, via rule 1.)

That's all! See Jeremy Siek's blog post `What is Gradual
Typing <http://wphomes.soic.indiana.edu/jsiek/what-is-gradual-typing/>`_
for a longer explanation and motivation. Note that rule 3 places **Any**
at the root of the class graph. This makes it very similar to
**object**. The difference is that **object** is not consistent with
most types (e.g. you can't use an object() instance where an int is
expected). IOW both **Any** and **object** mean "any type is allowed"
when used to annotate an argument, but only **Any** can be passed no
matter what type is expected (in essence, **Any** shuts up complaints
from the static checker).

Here's an example showing how these rules work out in practice:

Say we have an Employee class, and a subclass Manager:

-  class Employee: ...
-  class Manager(Employee): ...

Let's say variable e is declared with type Employee:

-  e = Employee()  # type: Employee

Now it's okay to assign a Manager instance to e (rule 1):

-  e = Manager()

It's not okay to assign an Employee instance to a variable declared with
type Manager:

-  m = Manager()  # type: Manager
-  m = Employee()  # Fails static check

However, suppose we have a variable whose type is **Any**:

-  a = some\_func()  # type: Any

Now it's okay to assign a to e (rule 2):

-  e = a  # OK

Of course it's also okay to assign e to a (rule 3), but we didn't need
the concept of consistency for that:

-  a = e  # OK


Notational conventions
----------------------

-  t1, t2 etc.  and u1, u2 etc. are types or classes. Sometimes we write
   ti or tj to refer to "any of t1, t2, etc."
-  X, Y etc. are type variables (defined with TypeVar(), see below).
-  C, D etc. are classes defined with a class statement.
-  x, y etc. are objects or instances.
-  We use the terms type and class interchangeably, and we assume
   type(x) is x.\_\_class\_\_.


General rules
-------------

-  Instance-ness is derived from class-ness, e.g. x is an instance of
   t1 if type(x) is a subclass of t1.
-  No types defined below (i.e. Any, Union etc.) can be instantiated.
   (But non-abstract subclasses of Generic can be.)
-  No types defined below can be subclassed, except for Generic and
   classes derived from it.
-  Where a type is expected, None can be substituted for type(None);
   e.g. Union[t1, None] == Union[t1, type(None)].


Types
-----

-  **Any**. Every class is a subclass of Any; however, to the static
   type checker it is also consistent with every class (see above).
-  **Union[t1, t2, ...]**. Classes that are subclass of at least one of
   t1 etc. are subclasses of this. So are unions whose components are
   all subclasses of t1 etc. (Example: Union[int, str] is a subclass of
   Union[int, float, str].) The order of the arguments doesn't matter.
   (Example: Union[int, str] == Union[str, int].) If ti is itself a
   Union the result is flattened. (Example: Union[int, Union[float,
   str]] == Union[int, float, str].) If ti and tj have a subclass
   relationship, the less specific type survives. (Example:
   Union[Employee, Manager] == Union[Employee].) Union[t1] returns just
   t1. Union[] is illegal, so is Union[()]. Corollary: Union[..., Any,
   ...] returns Any; Union[..., object, ...] returns object; to cut a
   tie, Union[Any, object] == Union[object, Any] == Any.
-  **Optional[t1]**. Alias for Union[t1, None], i.e. Union[t1,
   type(None)].
-  **Tuple[t1, t2, ..., tn]**. A tuple whose items are instances of t1
   etc.. Example: Tuple[int, float] means a tuple of two items, the
   first is an int, the second a float; e.g., (42, 3.14). Tuple[u1, u2,
   ..., um] is a subclass of Tuple[t1, t2, ..., tn] if they have the
   same length (n==m) and each ui is a subclass of ti. To spell the type
   of the empty tuple, use Tuple[()]. A variadic homogeneous tuple type
   can be written Tuple[t1, ...]. (That's three dots, a literal ellipsis;
   and yes, that's a valid token in Python's syntax.)
-  **Callable[[t1, t2, ..., tn], tr]**. A function with positional
   argument types t1 etc., and return type tr. The argument list may be
   empty (n==0). There is no way to indicate optional or keyword
   arguments, nor varargs, but you can say the argument list is entirely
   unchecked by writing Callable[..., tr] (again, a literal ellipsis).
   This is covariant in the return type, but contravariant in the
   arguments. "Covariant" here means that for two callable types that
   differ only in the return type, the subclass relationship for the
   callable types follows that of the return types. (Example:
   Callable[[], Manager] is a subclass of Callable[[], Employee].)
   "Contravariant" here means that for two callable types that differ
   only in the type of one argument, the subclass relationship for the
   callable types goes in the opposite direction as for the argument
   types. (Example: Callable[[Employee], None] is a subclass of
   Callable[[Mananger], None]. Yes, you read that right.)

We might add:

-  **Intersection[t1, t2, ...]**. Classes that are subclass of *each* of
   t1, etc are subclasses of this. (Compare to Union, which has *at
   least one* instead of *each* in its definition.) The order of the
   arguments doesn't matter. Nested intersections are flattened, e.g.
   Intersection[int, Intersection[float, str]] == Intersection[int,
   float, str]. An intersection of fewer types is a subclass of an
   intersection of more types, e.g. Intersection[int, str] is a subclass
   of Intersection[int, float, str]. An intersection of one argument is
   just that argument, e.g. Intersection[int] is int. When argument have
   a subclass relationship, the more specific class survives, e.g.
   Intersection[str, Employee, Manager] is Intersection[str, Manager].
   Intersection[] is illegal, so is Intersection[()]. Corollary: Any
   disappears from the argument list, e.g. Intersection[int, str, Any]
   == Intersection[int, str]. Intersection[Any, object] is object. The
   interaction between Intersection and Union is complex but should be
   no surprise if you understand the interaction between intersections
   and unions in set theory (note that sets of types can be infinite in
   size, since there is no limit on the number of new subclasses).


Pragmatics
----------

Some things are irrelevant to the theory but make practical use more
convenient. (This is not a full list; I probably missed a few and some
are still controversial or not fully specified.)

- Type aliases, e.g.

  *  Point = Tuple[float, float]
  *  def distance(p: Point) -> float: ...

- Forward references via strings, e.g.

  * class C:
  
    + def compare(self, other: 'C') -> int: ...

- If a default of None is specified, the type is implicitly Optional, e.g.

  *  def get(key: KT, default: VT = None) -> VT: ...

- Don't use dynamic type expressions; use builtins and imported types
  only. No 'if'.

  *  def display(message: str if WINDOWS else bytes):  # NOT OK

- Type declaration in comments, e.g.

  *  x = []  # type: Sequence[int]

- Type declarations using Undefined, e.g.

  *  x = Undefined(str)

- Casts using cast(T, x), e.g.

  * x = cast(Any, frobozz())

- Other things, e.g. overloading and stub modules; best left to an
  actual PEP.


Generic types
-------------

(TODO: Explain more. See also the `mypy docs on
generics <http://mypy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/generics.html>`_.)

- **X = TypeVar('X')**. Declares a unique type variable. The name must match
  the variable name.

- **Y = TypeVar('Y', t1, t2, ...).** Ditto, constrained to t1 etc. Behaves
  like Union[t1, t2, ...] for most purposes, but when used as a type
  variable, subclasses of t1 etc. are replaced by the most-derived base
  class among t1 etc.

- Example of constrained type variables:

  * AnyStr = TypeVar('AnyStr', str, bytes)

  * def longest(a: AnyStr, b: AnyStr) -> AnyStr:

    -  return a if len(a) >= len(b) else b

  * x = longest('a', 'abc')  # The inferred type for x is str

  * y = longest('a', b'abc')  # Fails static type check

  * In this example, both arguments to longest() must have the same type
    (str or bytes), and moreover, even if the arguments are instances of a
    common str subclass, the return type is still str, not that subclass
    (see next example).

- For comparison, if the type variable was unconstrained, the common
  subclass would be chosen as the return type, e.g.:

  * S = TypeVar('S')

  * def longest(a: S, b: S) -> S:

    -  return a if len(a) >= b else b

  * class MyStr(str): ...

  * x = longest(MyStr('a'), MyStr('abc'))

  * The inferred type of x is MyStr (whereas in the AnyStr example it would
    be str).

- Also for comparison, if a Union is used, the return type also has to be
  a Union:

  * U = Union[str, bytes]

  * def longest(a: U, b: U) -> U:

    -  return a if len(a) >= b else b

  * x = longest('a', 'abc')

  * The inferred type of x is still Union[str, bytes], even though both
    arguments are str.

- **class C(Generic[X, Y, ...]):** ... Define a generic class C over type
  variables X etc. C itself becomes parameterizable, e.g. C[int, str, ...]
  is a specific class with substitutions X->int etc.

- TODO: Explain use of generic types in function signatures. E.g.
  Sequence[X], Sequence[int], Sequence[Tuple[X, Y, Z]], and mixtures.
  Think about co\*variance. No gimmicks like deriving from
  Sequence[Union[int, str]] or Sequence[Union[int, X]].


Predefined generic types and Protocols in typing.py
---------------------------------------------------

(See also the `typing.py module
<https://github.com/ambv/typehinting/blob/master/prototyping/typing.py>`_.)

-  Everything from collections.abc (but Set renamed to AbstractSet).
-  Dict, List, Set, FrozenSet, a few more.
-  re.Pattern[AnyStr], re.Match[AnyStr].
-  re.IO[AnyStr], re.TextIO ~ re.IO[str], re.BinaryIO ~ re.IO[bytes].
