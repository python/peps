<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#abstract" role="doc-backlink">Abstract</a></h2>
<p>This PEP proposes a mechanism by which projects hosted on <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org">pypi.org</a> can safely host wheel artifacts on external sites other
than PyPI. This PEP explicitly does <em>not</em> propose external hosting of
projects, packages, or their metadata. That functionality is already available
by externally hosting independent package indexes. Because this PEP only
provides a mechanism for projects to customize the download URL for specific
released wheel artifacts, dependency resolution as already implemented by
common installer tools such as <a class="reference external" href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/">pip</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/">uv</a> does not need to change.</p>
<p>This PEP defines what it means to be “safe” in this context, along with a new
package upload file format called a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.rim</span></code> file. It defines how <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.rim</span></code>
files affect the metadata returned for a package’s <a class="reference external" href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/simple-repository-api/#simple-repository-api" title="(in Python Packaging User Guide)"><span class="xref std std-ref">Simple Repository API</span></a>
in both HTML and JSON formats, and how traditional wheels can easily be turned
into <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.rim</span></code> files.</p>

<section id="pep-withdrawn">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#pep-withdrawn" role="doc-backlink">PEP withdrawn</a></h2>
<p>This PEP was withdrawn by the authors on 2025-01-31.  Our reading of the sentiment in the discussion
thread is that, while the problems this PEP attempts to solve are valid, most folks would prefer a
different approach.  Specifically, our read is that most users would prefer more control over the
ability to specify multiple indexes, how those indexes interoperate, and the priority and trust
assertions for those indexes.  For example, solutions such as <a class="pep reference internal" href="../pep-0766/" title="PEP 766 – Explicit Priority Choices Among Multiple Indexes">PEP 766</a> may provide a better way
forward.  Existing stop gap measures (e.g. PyPI limit increase requests and the <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/wheel-stub/">“wheel-stub”</a> approach) are sufficient – if not ideal – in the
meantime.  The authors wish to thank everyone who contributed to the constructive discussion, and
especially those who showed their support for this PEP, both in public and private.</p>
</section>
<section id="rationale">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#rationale" role="doc-backlink">Rationale</a></h2>
<p>The Python Package Index, hosted at <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org">https://pypi.org</a>, imposes <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/help/">default limits</a> on upload artifact file size (100 MiB) and total project size
(10 GiB). Most projects can comfortably fit within these limits during the lifetime of the
project, through years of uploads. A few projects have encountered these limits, and have
been granted both file size and project size exceptions, allowing them to continue
uploading new releases without having to take more drastic measures, such as removing
files which may potentially still be in use by consumers (e.g. through version pins).</p>
<p>A related workaround is the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/wheel-next/wheel-stub">“wheel stub”</a>
approach, which provides an indirect link between PyPI and an external third party package
index, where such limitations can be avoided. Wheel stubs are <a class="reference external" href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/source-distribution-format/#source-distribution-format" title="(in Python Packaging User Guide)"><span class="xref std std-ref">source distributions</span></a> (a.k.a. “sdists”) which utilize a <a class="pep reference internal" href="../pep-0517/" title="PEP 517 – A build-system independent format for source trees">PEP 517</a> build
backend that, instead of turning source code into a binary wheel, performs some logic to
calculate the URL for an existing, externally hosted wheel to download and install.  This
approach works, but it obscures the connection between PyPI, the sdist, and the externally
hosted wheel, since there is no way to present this information to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pip</span></code> or other such
tools.</p>
<section id="historical-context">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#historical-context" role="doc-backlink">Historical context</a></h3>
<p>In 2013, <a class="pep reference internal" href="../pep-0438/" title="PEP 438 – Transitioning to release-file hosting on PyPI">PEP 438</a> proposed a “backward-compatible two-phase transition
process” to modify several aspects of release file hosting on PyPI. As this
PEP describes, PyPI originally supported only project and release
<em>registration</em> without also allowing for artifact file hosting. As such, most
projects hosted release file artifacts elsewhere. Artifact hosting was later
added, but the mix of externally and PyPI-hosted files led to a wide range of
usability and potential security-related problems. PEP 438 was an attempt to
provide several facilities to allow external hosting while promoting a
PyPI-first hosting preference.</p>
<p>PEP 438 was complex, with three different “hosting modes”, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rel</span></code> metadata in
the simple HTML index pages to signify hosting locations, and a two-phase
transition plan affecting PyPI and installer tools.  PEP 438 was ultimately
retracted in 2015 by <a class="pep reference internal" href="../pep-0470/" title="PEP 470 – Removing External Hosting Support on PyPI">PEP 470</a>, which acknowledges that PEP 438 did succeed
in…</p>
<blockquote>
<div>bringing about more people to utilize PyPI’s repository features, an
altogether good thing given the global CDN powering PyPI providing speed
ups for a lot of people[…]</div></blockquote>
<p>Instead of external hosting, PEP 470 promoted the use of explicit multiple
repositories, providing full package indexing and artifact hosting, and
enabled through installer tool support, such as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pip</span> <span class="pre">install</span>
<span class="pre">--extra-index-url</span></code> allowing <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pip</span></code> to essentially treat multiple
repositories as <a class="reference external" href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_install/#cmdoption-extra-index-url">one single global repository</a>
for package installation resolution. Because this has been the blessed norm
for so many years, all Python package installation tools support querying
multiple indexes for dependency resolution.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-problem-with-multiple-indexes">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#the-problem-with-multiple-indexes" role="doc-backlink">The problem with multiple indexes</a></h3>
<p>Why then does this PEP propose to allow a more limited form of external
hosting, and how does this proposal avoid the problems documented in PEP 470?</p>
<p>One well-known problem that consolidating multiple indexes enables is
<a class="reference external" href="https://medium.com/&#64;alex.birsan/dependency-confusion-4a5d60fec610">dependency confusion attacks</a>, to
which Python <em>can</em> be particularly vulnerable, due to the algorithm that <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pip</span>
<span class="pre">install</span></code> uses for resolving package dependencies and preferred versions. The
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">uv</span></code> tool addresses this by supporting an additional <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/settings/#index-strategy">index strategy</a> option,
whereby users can select between, e.g. a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pip</span></code>-compatible strategy, and a
more limited strategy that prevents such dependency confusion attacks.</p>
<p><a class="pep reference internal" href="../pep-0708/" title="PEP 708 – Extending the Repository API to Mitigate Dependency Confusion Attacks">PEP 708</a> provides additional background about dependency confusion attacks,
and takes a different approach to preventing them. At its core, PEP 708 allows
repository owners to indicate that projects track across different
repositories, which allows installers to determine how to treat the global
package namespace when combined across multiple repositories. PEP 708 has been
provisionally accepted, pending several required conditions as outlined in PEP
708, some of which may have an indeterminate future. As PEP 708 itself says,
this won’t by itself solve dependency confusion attacks, but is one way to
provide enough information to installers to help minimize these attacks.</p>
<p>While there can still be valid use cases for standing up a totally independent
package index (such as providing richer platform support for GPUs until a
fully formed <a class="reference external" href="https://discuss.python.org/t/selecting-variant-wheels-according-to-a-semi-static-specification/53446">variant proposal</a>
is accepted), this PEP takes a different, simpler approach and doesn’t replace
any of the existing, proposed, or approved package index cooperation
specifications.</p>
<p>This PEP also preserves the core purpose of PyPI, and allows it to
remain the traditional, canonical, centralized index of all Python
packages.</p>
</section>
<section id="addressing-pypi-limits">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#addressing-pypi-limits" role="doc-backlink">Addressing PyPI limits</a></h3>
<p>This proposal also addresses the problem of size limits imposed by PyPI, where there is a
<a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/help/#file-size-limit">default artifact size limit</a> of 100 MiB and a
default overall <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/help/#project-size-limit">project size limit</a> of 10
GiB. Most packages and artifacts can easily fit in these limits, even for packages
containing binary extension modules for a variety of platforms. A small, but important
class of packages routinely exceed these limits, requiring them to submit PyPI <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pypi/support/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+file+limit+request">exception
request support tickets</a>. It’s not necessarily difficult to get resolution on such
exceptions, but it is a special process that can take some time to resolve, and the
criteria for granting such exceptions aren’t well documented.</p>
</section>
<section id="reducing-operational-complexity">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#reducing-operational-complexity" role="doc-backlink">Reducing operational complexity</a></h3>
<p>Setting up and maintaining an entire package index can be a complex
operational solution, both time and resource intensive. This is especially
true if the main purpose of such an index is just to avoid file size
limitations. The external index approach also imposes a tricky UX on consumers
of projects on the external index, requiring them to understand how CLI
options such as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--external-index-url</span></code> work, along with the security
implications of such flags. It would be much easier for both producers and
consumers of large wheel packages to just set up and maintain a simple web
server, capable of serving individual files with no more complex API than
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">HTTP</span> <span class="pre">GET</span></code>. Such an interface is also easily cacheable or placed behind a
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network">CDN</a>. Simple HTTP
servers are also much easier to audit for security purposes, easier to proxy,
and usually take much less resources to run, support, and maintain.  Even
something like <a class="reference external" href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a> could be used to
host external wheels.</p>
<p>This PEP proposes an approach that favors such operational simplicity.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="specification">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#specification" role="doc-backlink">Specification</a></h2>
<p>A new type of uploadable file is defined, called a “RIM” (i.e. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.rim</span></code>), or “Remote
Installable Metadata” file.  The name evokes the image of a wheel with the tire removed,
and emphasizes that <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.rim</span></code> files are easily derived from <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.whl</span></code> files.  The process of
turning a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.whl</span></code> into a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.rim</span></code> is <a class="reference internal" href="#dismounting"><span class="std std-ref">outlined below</span></a>. The file name
format exactly matches the <a class="reference external" href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/binary-distribution-format/#wheel-file-name-spec" title="(in Python Packaging User Guide)"><span class="xref std std-ref">wheel file naming format</span></a> specification, except that RIM files use the suffix
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.rim</span></code>. This means that all the tags used to discriminate <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.whl</span></code> files also
distinguish between different <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.rim</span></code> files, and thus can be used during dependency
resolution steps, exactly as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.whl</span></code> files are today. In this respect, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.whl</span></code> and
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.rim</span></code> files are interchangeable.</p>
<p>The content of a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.rim</span></code> file is <em>nearly</em> identical to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.whl</span></code> files, however <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.rim</span></code>
files <strong>MUST</strong> contain only the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.dist-info</span></code> directory from a wheel. No other top-level
file or directory is allowed in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.rim</span></code> zip file. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.dist-info</span></code> directory
<strong>MUST</strong> contain a single additional file in addition to those <a class="reference external" href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/binary-distribution-format/#the-dist-info-directory">allowed</a> in a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.whl</span></code>

<p>The only effect of a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.rim</span></code> file is to change the download URL for the wheel artifact in
both the HTML and JSON interfaces in the <a class="reference external" href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/simple-repository-api/#">simple repository API</a>.  In the HTML page for a

including a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">#&lt;hashname&gt;=&lt;hashvalue&gt;</span></code> fragment.  this hash fragment <strong>MUST</strong> be in
exactly the same format as described the <a class="pep reference internal" href="../pep-0376/" title="PEP 376 – Database of Installed Python Distributions">PEP 376</a> originated <a class="reference external" href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/binary-distribution-format/#signed-wheel-files">signed wheel file format</a>
in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.dist-info/RECORD</span></code> file. The exact same rules for selection of hash algorithm
and encoding is used here.</p>
<p>Similarly in the <a class="reference external" href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/simple-repository-api/#json-based-simple-api-for-python-package-indexes">JSON response</a> the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">url</span></code> key pointing to the download file must be
the value of the <a class="reference internal" href="#file-format"><span class="std std-ref">uri</span></a> key, and the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">hashes</span></code> dictionary <strong>MUST</strong> be
included with values populated from the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">hashes</span></code> dictionary provided above.</p>
<p>In all other respects, a compliant package index should treat <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.rim</span></code> files the same as
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.whl</span></code> files, with some other minor exceptions as outlined below. For example, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.rim</span></code>
files can be <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/help/#deletion">deleted</a> and yanked (<a class="pep reference internal" href="../pep-0592/" title="PEP 592 – Adding “Yank” Support to the Simple API">PEP 592</a>) just
like any <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.whl</span></code> file, with the exact same semantics (i.e. deletions are permanent). When
a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.rim</span></code> is deleted, an index <strong>MUST NOT</strong> allow a matching <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.whl</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.rim</span></code> file to

allows uploaders to replace an externally hosted wheel file with an index hosted wheel
file, but the converse is prohibited. Since the default is to host wheels on the same

<section id="external-hosting-resiliency">
<span id="resiliency"></span><h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#external-hosting-resiliency" role="doc-backlink">External hosting resiliency</a></h2>
<p>One of the key concerns leading to PEP 438’s revocation in PEP 470 was
potential user confusion when an external index disappeared. From PEP 470:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>This confusion comes down to end users of projects not realizing if a
project is hosted on PyPI or if it relies on an external service. This
often manifests itself when the external service is down but PyPI is
not. People will see that PyPI works, and other projects works, but this
one specific one does not. They oftentimes do not realize who they need to
contact in order to get this fixed or what their remediation steps are.</div></blockquote>
<p>While the problem of external wheel hosting service going down is not directly
solved by this PEP, several safeguards are in place to greatly reduce the
potential burden on PyPI administrators.</p>
<p>This PEP thus proposes that:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>External wheel hosting is only allowed for packages which are owned by
<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.pypi.org/organization-accounts/">organization accounts</a>.
External hosting is an organization-wide setting.</li>
<li>Organization accounts do not automatically gain the ability to externally
host wheels; this feature MUST be explicitly enabled by PyPI admins at their discretion. Since
this will not be a common request, we don’t expect the overhead to be nearly
as burdensome as <a class="pep reference internal" href="../pep-0541/" title="PEP 541 – Package Index Name Retention">PEP 541</a> resolutions, account recovery requests, or even
file/project size increase requests.  External hosting requests would be
handled in the same manner as those requests, i.e. via the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pypi/support">PyPI GitHub
support tracker</a>.</li>
<li>Organization accounts requesting external wheel hosting <strong>MUST</strong> register their own
support contact URI, be it a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mailto</span></code> URI for a contact email address, or the URL to
the organization’s support tracker. Such a contact URI is optional for organizations
which do not avail themselves of external wheel file hosting.</li>
</ul>
<p>Combined with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">EXTERNAL-HOSTING.json</span></code> file’s <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">owner</span></code> key, this allows for
installer tools to unambiguously redirect any download errors away from the PyPI support
admins and squarely to the organization’s support admins.</p>
<p>While the exact mechanics of storing and retrieving this organization support
URL will be defined separately, for the sake of example, let’s say a package
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">foo</span></code> externally hosts wheel files on <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">`https://foo.example.com</span></code>
&lt;<a class="reference external" href="https://foo.example.com">https://foo.example.com</a>&gt;`__ and that host becomes unreachable. When an
installer tool tries to download and install the package <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">foo</span></code> wheel, the
download step will fail. The installer would then be able to query PyPI to
provide a useful error message to the end user:</p>
<ul>
<li>The installer downloads the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.rim</span></code> file and reads the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">owner</span></code> key from the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">EXTERNAL-HOSTING.json</span></code> file inside the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.rim</span></code> zip file.</li>
<li>The installer queries PyPI for the support URI for the organization
owner of the externally hosted wheel.</li>
<li>An informative error message would then be displayed, e.g.:<blockquote>
<div>The externally hosted wheel file <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">foo-....whl</span></code> could not be
downloaded. Please contact <a class="reference external" href="mailto:support&#37;&#52;&#48;foo&#46;example&#46;com">support<span>&#64;</span>foo<span>&#46;</span>example<span>&#46;</span>com</a> for help. Do not report
this to the PyPI administrators.</div></blockquote>

</ul>

<section id="dismounting-wheels">
<span id="dismounting"></span><h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#dismounting-wheels" role="doc-backlink">Dismounting wheels</a></h2>
<p>It is generally very easy to produce a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.rim</span></code> file from an existing <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.whl</span></code>
file. This could be done efficiently by a <a class="pep reference internal" href="../pep-0518/" title="PEP 518 – Specifying Minimum Build System Requirements for Python Projects">PEP 518</a> build backend with an
additional command line option, or a separate tool which takes a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.whl</span></code> file
as input and creates the associated <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.rim</span></code> file. To complete the analogy,
the act of turning a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.whl</span></code> into a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.rim</span></code> is called “dismounting”.  The
steps such a tool would take are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Accept as input the source <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.whl</span></code> file, the organization owner of the
package, and URL at which the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.whl</span></code> will be hosted, and the support URI
to report download problems from. These could in fact be captured in the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pyproject.toml</span></code> file, but that specification is out of scope for this
PEP.</li>
<li>Unzip the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.whl</span></code> and create the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.rim</span></code> zip archive.</li>
<li>Omit from the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.rim</span></code> file any path in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.whl</span></code> that <strong>isn’t</strong> rooted
at the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.dist-info</span></code> directory.</li>
<li>Calculate the hash of the source <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.whl</span></code> file.</li>
<li>Add the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">EXTERNAL-HOSTING.json</span></code> file containing the JSON keys and values as described
above, to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.rim</span></code> archive.</li>

</section>
<section id="changes-to-tools">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#changes-to-tools" role="doc-backlink">Changes to tools</a></h2>
<p>Theoretically, installer tools shouldn’t need any changes, since when they
have identified the wheel to download and install, they simply consult the
download URLs returned by PyPI’s Simple API. In practice though, tools such as
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pip</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">uv</span></code> may have constrained lists of hosts they will allow
downloads from, such as PyPI’s own <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pythonhosted.org</span></code> domain.</p>
<p>In this case, such tools will need to relax those constraints, but the exact policy for
this is left to the installer tools themselves. Any number of approaches could be
implemented, such as downloading the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.rim</span></code> file and verifying the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">EXTERNAL-HOSTING.json</span></code> metadata, or simply trusting the external downloads for any
wheel with a matching checksum.  They could also query PyPI for the project’s organization
owner and support URI before trusting the download. They could warn the user when
externally hosted wheel files are encountered, and/or require the use of a command line
option to enable additional download hosts. Any of these verification policies could be
chosen in configuration files.</p>
<p>Installer tools should also probably provide better error messages when
externally hosted wheels cannot be downloaded, e.g. because a host is
unreachable. As described above, such tools could query enough metadata from
PyPI to provide clear and distinct error messages pointing users to the
package’s external hosting support email or issue tracker.</p>

<section id="constraints-for-external-hosting-services">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#constraints-for-external-hosting-services" role="doc-backlink">Constraints for external hosting services</a></h2>
<p>The following constraints lead to reliable and compatible external wheel hosting services:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>External wheels <strong>MUST</strong> be served over HTTPS, with a certificate signed by
<a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA">Mozilla’s root certificate store</a>. This ensures
compatibility with <a class="reference external" href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/topics/https-certificates/">pip</a>
and <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/configuration/authentication/#custom-ca-certificates">uv</a>.  At
the time of this writing, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pip</span></code> 24.2 on Python 3.10 or newer uses the system
certificate store in addition to the Mozilla store provided by the third party <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/certifi/">certifi</a> Python package. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">uv</span></code> uses the Mozilla store
provided by the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/rustls/webpki-roots">webpki-roots</a> crate, but not
the system store unless the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--native-tls</span></code> flag is given <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#fn1" id="id1">[1]</a>.  <em>The PyPI
administrators may modify this requirement in the future, but compatibility with popular
installers will not be compromised.</em></li>
<li>External wheel hosts <strong>SHOULD</strong> use a content delivery network (<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network">CDN</a>), just as PyPI does.</li>
<li>External wheel hosts <strong>MUST</strong> commit to a stable URL for all wheels they host.</li>
<li>Externally hosted wheels <strong>MUST NOT</strong> be removed from an external wheel host unless the
corresponding <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.rim</span></code> file is deleted from PyPI first, and <strong>MUST NOT</strong> remove external
wheels for yanked releases.</li>
<li>External wheel hosts <strong>MUST</strong> support <a class="reference external" href="https://http.dev/range-request">HTTP range requests</a>.</li>
<li>External wheel hosts <strong>SHOULD</strong> support the <a class="reference external" href="https://http.dev/2">HTTP/2</a> protocol.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="security">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#security" role="doc-backlink">Security</a></h2>
<p>Several factors as described in this proposal should mitigate security
concerns with externally hosted wheels, such as:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Wheel file checksums <strong>MUST</strong> be included in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.rim</span></code> files, and once uploaded cannot be
changed. Since the checksum stored on PyPI is immutable and required, it is not possible
to spoof an external wheel file, even if the owning organization lost control of their
hosting domain.</li>
<li>Externally hosted wheels <strong>MUST</strong> be served over HTTPS.</li>
<li>In order to serve externally hosted wheels, organizations <strong>MUST</strong> be approved by the
PyPI admins.</li>
</ul>
<p>When users identify malware or vulnerabilities in PyPI-hosted projects, they can now
report this using the <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/security/">malware reporting facilities</a> on
PyPI, as also described in this <a class="reference external" href="https://blog.pypi.org/posts/2024-03-06-malware-reporting-evolved/">blog post</a>.  The same process can be used to report
security issues in externally hosted wheels, and the same remediation process should be
used.  In addition, since organizations with external hosting enabled MUST provide a
support contact URI, that URI can be used in some cases to report the security issue to
the hosting organization.  Such organization reporting won’t make sense for malware, but
could indeed be a very useful way to report security vulnerabilities in externally hosted
wheels.</p>
</section>
<section id="rejected-ideas">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#rejected-ideas" role="doc-backlink">Rejected ideas</a></h2>
<p>Several ideas were considered and rejected.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Requiring digital signatures on externally hosted wheel files, either in
addition to or other than hashes. We deem this unnecessary since the
checksum requirement should be enough to validate that the metadata on PyPI
for a wheel exactly matches the downloaded wheel.  The added complexity of
key management outweighs any additional benefit such digital signatures
might convey.</li>
<li>Hash verification on <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.rim</span></code> file uploads. PyPI <em>could</em> verify that the hash in the
uploaded <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.rim</span></code> file matches the externally hosted wheel before it accepts the upload,
but this requires downloading the external wheel and performing the checksum, which also
implies that the upload of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.rim</span></code> file cannot be accepted until this external
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.whl</span></code> file is downloaded and verified. This increases PyPI bandwidth and slows down
the upload query, although <a class="pep reference internal" href="../pep-0694/" title="PEP 694 – Upload 2.0 API for Python Package Indexes">PEP 694</a> draft uploads could potentially mitigate these
concerns. Still, the benefit is not likely worth the additional complexity.</li>
<li>Periodic verification of the download URLs by the index. PyPI could try to periodically
ensure that the external wheel host or the external <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.whl</span></code> file itself is still
available, e.g. via an <span class="target" id="index-0"></span><a class="rfc reference external" href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9110.html#section-9.3.2"><strong>HTTP HEAD</strong></a> request. This is likely overkill and without also
providing the file’s checksum in the response <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#fn2" id="id2">[2]</a>, may not provide much additional
benefit.</li>
<li>This PEP could allow for an organization to provide fallback download hosts,
such that a secondary is available if the primary goes down.  We believe
that DNS-based replication is a much better, well-known technique, and
probably much more resilient anyway.</li>
<li><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.rim</span></code> file replacement. While it is allowed for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.whl</span></code> files to replace
existing <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.rim</span></code> files, as long as a) the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.rim</span></code> file hasn’t been deleted
or yanked, b) the checksums match, we do not allow replacing <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.whl</span></code> files
with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.rim</span></code> files, nor do we allow a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.rim</span></code> file to overwrite an
existing <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.rim</span></code> file. This latter could be a technique to change the
hosting URL for an externally hosted <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.whl</span></code>; however, we do not think this
is a good idea. There are other ways to “fix” an external host URL as
described above, and we do not want to encourage mass re-uploads of existing
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.rim</span></code> files.</li>
