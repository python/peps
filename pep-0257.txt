Abstract

    This PEP documents the semantics and conventions associated with
    Python docstrings.


Specification

    All modules should normally have docstrings, and all functions and
    classes exported by a module should also have docstrings.  Public
    methods (including the __init__ constructor) should also have
    docstrings.

    [+] A package may be documented in the module docstring of the
    [+] __init__.py file in the package directory.

    The docstring of a script (a stand-alone program) should be usable
    as its "usage" message, printed when the script is invoked with
    incorrect or missing arguments (or perhaps with a "-h" option, for
    "help").  Such a docstring should document the script's function
    and command line syntax, environment variables, and files.  Usage
    messages can be fairly elaborate (several screens full) and should
    be sufficient for a new user to use the command properly, as well
    as a complete quick reference to all options and arguments for the
    sophisticated user.

    For consistency, always use """triple double quotes""" around
    docstrings.

    [+] Use r"""raw triple double quotes""" if you use any
    [+] backslashes in your docstrings.

    There are two forms of docstrings: one-liners and multi-line
    docstrings.

    One-line Docstrings
    --------------------

    One-liners are for really obvious cases.  They should really fit
    on one line.  For example:

        def kos_root():
            """Return the pathname of the KOS root directory."""
            global _kos_root
            if _kos_root: return _kos_root
            ...

    Notes: 

    - Triple quotes are used even though the string fits on one line.
      This makes it easy to later expand it.

    - The closing quotes are on the same line as the opening quotes.
      This looks better for one-liners.

    - There's no blank line either before or after the docstring. 

    - The docstring is a phrase ending in a period.  It prescribes the
      function's effect as a command ("Do this", "Return that"), not
      as a description: e.g. don't write "Returns the pathname ..."

    [+] - The one-line docstring should NOT be a "signature" reiterating
    [+]   the function parameters (which can be obtained by introspection).
    [+]   Don't do:

    [+]       def function(a, b):
    [+]           """function(a, b) -> list"""

    [+]   This type of docstring is only appropriate for C functions (such
    [+]   as built-ins), where introspection is not possible.

    Multi-line Docstrings
    ----------------------

    Multi-line docstrings consist of a summary line just like a
    one-line docstring, followed by a blank line, followed by a more
    elaborate description.  The summary line may be used by automatic
    indexing tools; it is important that it fits on one line and is
    separated from the rest of the docstring by a blank line.

    The entire docstring is indented the same as the quotes at its
    first line (see example below).  Docstring processing tools will
    strip an amount of indentation from the second and further lines
    of the docstring equal to the indentation of the first non-blank
    line after the first line of the docstring.  Relative indentation
    of later lines in the docstring is retained.

    Insert a blank line before and after all docstrings (one-line or
    multi-line) that document a class -- generally speaking, the
    class's methods are separated from each other by a single blank
    line, and the docstring needs to be offset from the first method
    by a blank line; for symmetry, put a blank line between the class
    header and the docstring.  Docstrings documenting functions
    generally don't have this requirement, unless the function's body
    is written as a number of blank-line separated sections -- in this
    case, treat the docstring as another section, and precede it with
    a blank line.

    The docstring for a module should generally list the classes,
    exceptions and functions (and any other objects) that are exported
    by the module, with a one-line summary of each.  (These summaries
    generally give less detail than the summary line in the object's
    docstring.)

    The docstring for a function or method should summarize its
    behavior and document its arguments, return value(s), side
    effects, exceptions raised, and restrictions on when it can be
    called (all if applicable).  Optional arguments should be
    indicated.  It should be documented whether keyword arguments are
    part of the interface.

    The docstring for a class should summarize its behavior and list
    the public methods and instance variables.  If the class is
    intended to be subclassed, and has an additional interface for
    subclasses, this interface should be listed separately (in the
    docstring).  The class constructor should be documented in the
    docstring for its __init__ method.  Individual methods should be
    documented by their own docstring.

    If a class subclasses another class and its behavior is mostly
    inherited from that class, its docstring should mention this and
    summarize the differences.  Use the verb "override" to indicate
    that a subclass method replaces a superclass method and does not
    call the superclass method; use the verb "extend" to indicate that
    a subclass method calls the superclass method (in addition to its
    own behavior).

    *Do not* use the Emacs convention of mentioning the arguments of
    functions or methods in upper case in running text.  Python is
    case sensitive and the argument names can be used for keyword
    arguments, so the docstring should document the correct argument
    names.  It is best to list each argument on a separate line,

    [-] with two dashes separating the name from the description,
    [-] like this:

        def complex(real=0.0, imag=0.0):
            """Form a complex number.
        
            Keyword arguments:
            real -- the real part (default 0.0)
            imag -- the imaginary part (default 0.0)
        
            """
            if imag == 0.0 and real == 0.0: return complex_zero
            ...

    [-] The BDFL [3] recommends inserting a blank line between the
    [-] last paragraph in a multi-line docstring and its closing quotes,
    [-] placing the closing quotes on a line by themselves.  This way,
    [-] Emacs' fill-paragraph command can be used on it.

    [+] Details" [4]
