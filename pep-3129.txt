Abstract
========

This PEP proposes class decorators, an extension to the function
and method decorators introduced in PEP 318.


Rationale
=========

When function decorators were originally debated for inclusion in
Python 2.4, class decorators were seen as obscure and unnecessary
[#obscure]_ thanks to metaclasses.  After several years' experience
with the Python 2.4.x series of releases and an increasing
familiarity with function decorators and their uses, the BDFL and
the community re-evaluated class decorators and recommended their
inclusion in Python 3.0 [#approval]_.

The motivating use-case was to make certain constructs more easily
expressed and less reliant on implementation details of the CPython
interpreter.  While it is possible to express class decorator-like
functionality using metaclasses, the results are generally
unpleasant and the implementation highly fragile [#motivation]_.  In
addition, metaclasses are inherited, whereas class decorators are not,
making metaclasses unsuitable for some, single class-specific uses of
class decorators. The fact that large-scale Python projects like Zope
were going through these wild contortions to achieve something like
class decorators won over the BDFL.


Semantics
=========

The semantics and design goals of class decorators are the same as
for function decorators ([#semantics]_, [#goals]_); the only
difference is that you're decorating a class instead of a function.
The following two snippets are semantically identical::

  class A:
    pass
  A = foo(bar(A))


  @foo
  @bar
  class A:
    pass

For a detailed examination of decorators, please refer to PEP 318.


Implementation
==============

Adapting Python's grammar to support class decorators requires
modifying two rules and adding a new rule::

 funcdef: [decorators] 'def' NAME parameters ['->' test] ':' suite

 compound_stmt: if_stmt | while_stmt | for_stmt | try_stmt |
                with_stmt | funcdef | classdef

need to be changed to ::

 decorated: decorators (classdef | funcdef)

 funcdef: 'def' NAME parameters ['->' test] ':' suite

 compound_stmt: if_stmt | while_stmt | for_stmt | try_stmt |
                with_stmt | funcdef | classdef | decorated

Adding ``decorated`` is necessary to avoid an ambiguity in the
grammar.

The Python AST and bytecode must be modified accordingly.

A reference implementation [#implementation]_ has been provided by
Jack Diederich.


Acceptance
==========

There was virtually no discussion following the posting of this PEP,
meaning that everyone agreed it should be accepted.

The patch was committed to Subversion as revision 55430.
