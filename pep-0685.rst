Abstract
========

This PEP specifies how to normalize `distribution extra <Provides-Extra_>`_
names when performing comparisons.
This prevents tools from either failing to find an extra name, or
accidentally matching against an unexpected name.


Motivation
==========

The `Provides-Extra`_ core metadata specification states that an extra's
name "must be a valid Python identifier".
:pep:`508` specifies that the value of an ``extra`` marker may contain a
letter, digit, or any one of ``.``, ``-``, or ``_`` after the initial character.
Otherwise, there is no other `PyPA specification
<https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/>`_
which outlines how extra names should be written or normalization for comparison.
Due to the amount of packaging-related code in existence,
it is important to evaluate current practices by the community and
standardize on one that doesn't break most code, while being
something tool authors can agree to following.

The issue of there being no standard was brought forward by an
`initial discussion <https://discuss.python.org/t/7614>`__
noting that the extra ``adhoc-ssl`` was not considered equal to the name
``adhoc_ssl`` by pip.


Rationale
=========

:pep:`503` specifies how to normalize distribution names::

    re.sub(r"[-_.]+", "-", name).lower()

This collapses any run of the substitution character down to a single
character,
e.g. ``---`` gets collapsed down to ``-``.
This does not produce a valid Python identifier as specified by the
core metadata specification for extra names.

`Setuptools does normalization <https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/blob/b2f7b8f92725c63b164d5776f85e67cc560def4e/pkg_resources/__init__.py#L1324-L1330>`__
via::

    re.sub('[^A-Za-z0-9.-]+', '_', name).lower()

The use of an underscore/``_`` differs from PEP 503's use of a
hyphen/``-``.
Runs of characters, unlike PEP 503, do **not** get collapsed,
e.g. ``___`` stays the same.

For pip, its
"extra normalisation behaviour is quite convoluted and erratic",
and so its use is not considered.


Specification
=============

When comparing extra names, tools MUST normalize the names being compared
using the equivalent semantics of::

    re.sub('[^A-Za-z0-9.-]+', '_', name).lower()

This normalizes any extra name previously allowed by :pep:`508` in a
fashion consistent with setuptools.

For tools writing `core metadata`_,
they MUST write out extra names in their normalized form.
This applies to the ``Provides-Extra`` and ``Provides-Dist`` fields,
both when specifying extras for a distribution as well as the
``extra`` marker.
This will also help enforce the current requirement from the core
metadata specification that extra names be valid Python identifiers.

Tools generating metadata MUST raise an error if a user specified
two or more extra names which would normalize to the same name.


Backwards Compatibility
=======================

Older distributions which contain conflicting names when normalized
will no longer have all of their extra names made available to users
as independent options, but instead as a single extra.
It is hoped that relying on setuptools' algorithm for normalization
will minimize the breakage from this.

As distributions make new releases using tools which implement this PEP,
the backwards-compatibility issues will become less of a concern.


Security Implications
=====================

It is possible that for a distribution that has conflicting extra names, a
tool ends up installing distributions that somehow weaken the security
of the system.
This is only hypothetical and if it were to occur, it would probably be
more of a security concern for the distributions specifying such extras names
rather than the distribution that pulled them in together.


How to Teach This
=================

This should be transparent to users on a day-to-day basis.
It will be up to tools to educate/stop users when they select extra
names which conflict.


Reference Implementation
========================

No reference implementation is provided aside from the code above,
but the expectation is the `packaging project`_ will provide a
function in its ``packaging.utils`` that will implement extra name
normalization.
It will also implement extra name comparisons appropriately.
Finally, if the project ever gains the ability to write out metadata,
it will also implement this PEP.


Rejected Ideas
==============

Normalize names according to PEP 503
------------------------------------

For backwards-compatibility concerns,
it was decided not to strictly follow how :pep:`503` normalizes
distribution names.
