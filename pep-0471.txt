Abstract
========

This PEP proposes including a new directory iteration function,
``os.scandir()``, in the standard library. This new function adds
useful functionality and increases the speed of ``os.walk()`` by 2-10
times (depending on the platform and file system) by significantly
reducing the number of times ``stat()`` needs to be called.


Rationale
=========

Python's built-in ``os.walk()`` is significantly slower than it needs
to be, because -- in addition to calling ``os.listdir()`` on each
directory -- it executes the system call ``os.stat()`` or
``GetFileAttributes()`` on each file to determine whether the entry is
a directory or not.

But the underlying system calls -- ``FindFirstFile`` /
``FindNextFile`` on Windows and ``readdir`` on Linux and OS X --
already tell you whether the files returned are directories or not, so
no further system calls are needed. In short, you can reduce the
number of system calls from approximately 2N to N, where N is the
total number of files and directories in the tree. (And because
directory trees are usually much wider than they are deep, it's often
much better than this.)

In practice, removing all those extra system calls makes ``os.walk()``
about **8-9 times as fast on Windows**, and about **2-3 times as fast
on Linux and Mac OS X**. So we're not talking about micro-
optimizations. See more `benchmarks`_.

.. _`benchmarks`: https://github.com/benhoyt/scandir#benchmarks

Somewhat relatedly, many people (see Python `Issue 11406`_) are also
keen on a version of ``os.listdir()`` that yields filenames as it
iterates instead of returning them as one big list. This improves
memory efficiency for iterating very large directories.

So as well as providing a ``scandir()`` iterator function for calling
directly, Python's existing ``os.walk()`` function could be sped up a
huge amount.

.. _`Issue 11406`: http://bugs.python.org/issue11406


Implementation
==============

The implementation of this proposal was written by Ben Hoyt (initial
version) and Tim Golden (who helped a lot with the C extension
module). It lives on GitHub at `benhoyt/scandir`_.

.. _`benhoyt/scandir`: https://github.com/benhoyt/scandir

Note that this module has been used and tested (see "Use in the wild"
section in this PEP), so it's more than a proof-of-concept. However,
it is marked as beta software and is not extensively battle-tested.
It will need some cleanup and more thorough testing before going into
the standard library, as well as integration into `posixmodule.c`.



Specifics of proposal
=====================

Specifically, this PEP proposes adding a single function to the ``os``
module in the standard library, ``scandir``, that takes a single,
optional string as its argument::

    scandir(path='.') -> generator of DirEntry objects

Like ``listdir``, ``scandir`` calls the operating system's directory
iteration system calls to get the names of the files in the ``path``
directory, but it's different from ``listdir`` in two ways:

* Instead of bare filename strings, it returns lightweight
  ``DirEntry`` objects that hold the filename string and provide
  simple methods that allow access to the stat-like data the operating
  system returned.

* It returns a generator instead of a list, so that ``scandir`` acts
  as a true iterator instead of returning the full list immediately.

``scandir()`` yields a ``DirEntry`` object for each file and directory
in ``path``. Just like ``listdir``, the ``'.'`` and ``'..'``
pseudo-directories are skipped, and the entries are yielded in
system-dependent order. Each ``DirEntry`` object has the following
attributes and methods:

* ``name``: the entry's filename, relative to ``path`` (corresponds to
  the return values of ``os.listdir``)

* ``is_dir()``: like ``os.path.isdir()``, but requires no system calls
  on most systems (Linux, Windows, OS X)

* ``is_file()``: like ``os.path.isfile()``, but requires no system
  calls on most systems (Linux, Windows, OS X)

* ``is_symlink()``: like ``os.path.islink()``, but requires no system
  calls on most systems (Linux, Windows, OS X)

* ``lstat()``: like ``os.lstat()``, but requires no system calls on
  Windows

The ``DirEntry`` attribute and method names were chosen to be the same
as those in the new ``pathlib`` module for consistency.


Notes on caching
----------------

The ``DirEntry`` objects are relatively dumb -- the ``name`` attribute
is obviously always cached, and the ``is_X`` and ``lstat`` methods
cache their values (immediately on Windows via ``FindNextFile``, and
on first use on Linux / OS X via a ``stat`` call) and never refetch
from the system.

For this reason, ``DirEntry`` objects are intended to be used and
thrown away after iteration, not stored in long-lived data structured
and the methods called again and again.

If a user wants to do that (for example, for watching a file's size
change), they'll need to call the regular ``os.lstat()`` or
``os.path.getsize()`` functions which force a new system call each
time.


Examples
========

Here's a good usage pattern for ``scandir``. This is in fact almost
exactly how the scandir module's faster ``os.walk()`` implementation
uses it::

    dirs = []
    non_dirs = []
    for entry in scandir(path):
        if entry.is_dir():
            dirs.append(entry)
        else:
            non_dirs.append(entry)

The above ``os.walk()``-like code will be significantly using scandir
on both Windows and Linux or OS X.

Or, for getting the total size of files in a directory tree -- showing
use of the ``DirEntry.lstat()`` method::

    def get_tree_size(path):
        """Return total size of files in path and subdirs."""
        size = 0
        for entry in scandir(path):
            if entry.is_dir():
                sub_path = os.path.join(path, entry.name)
                size += get_tree_size(sub_path)
            else:
                size += entry.lstat().st_size
        return size

Note that ``get_tree_size()`` will get a huge speed boost on Windows,
because no extra stat call are needed, but on Linux and OS X the size
information is not returned by the directory iteration functions, so
this function won't gain anything there.


Support
=======

The scandir module on GitHub has been forked and used quite a bit (see
"Use in the wild" in this PEP), but there's also been a fair bit of
direct support for a scandir-like function from core developers and
others on the python-dev and python-ideas mailing lists. A sampling:

* **Nick Coghlan**, a core Python developer: "I've had the local Red
  Hat release engineering team express their displeasure at having to
  stat every file in a network mounted directory tree for info that is
  present in the dirent structure, so a definite +1 to os.scandir from
  me, so long as it makes that info available."
  [`source1 <http://bugs.python.org/issue11406>`_]

* **Tim Golden**, a core Python developer, supports scandir enough to
  have spent time refactoring and significantly improving scandir's C
  extension module.
  [`source2 <https://github.com/tjguk/scandir>`_]

* **Christian Heimes**, a core Python developer: "+1 for something
  like yielddir()"
  [`source3 <https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-ideas/2012-November/017772.html>`_]
  and "Indeed! I'd like to see the feature in 3.4 so I can remove my
  own hack from our code base."
  [`source4 <http://bugs.python.org/issue11406>`_]

* **Gregory P. Smith**, a core Python developer: "As 3.4beta1 happens
  tonight, this isn't going to make 3.4 so i'm bumping this to 3.5.
  I really like the proposed design outlined above."
  [`source5 <http://bugs.python.org/issue11406>`_]

* **Guido van Rossum** on the possibility of adding scandir to Python
  3.5 (as it was too late for 3.4): "The ship has likewise sailed for
  adding scandir() (whether to os or pathlib). By all means experiment
  and get it ready for consideration for 3.5, but I don't want to add
  it to 3.4."
  [`source6 <https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2013-November/130583.html>`_]

Support for this PEP itself (meta-support?) was given by Nick Coghlan
on python-dev: "A PEP reviewing all this for 3.5 and proposing a
specific os.scandir API would be a good thing."
[`source7 <https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2013-November/130588.html>`_]


Use in the wild
===============

To date, ``scandir`` is definitely useful, but has been clearly marked
"beta", so it's uncertain how much use of it there is in the wild. Ben
Hoyt has had several reports from people using it. For example:

* Chris F: "I am processing some pretty large directories and was half
  expecting to have to modify getdents. So thanks for saving me the
  effort." [via personal email]

* bschollnick: "I wanted to let you know about this, since I am using
  Scandir as a building block for this code. Here's a good example of
  scandir making a radical performance improvement over os.listdir."
  [`source8 <https://github.com/benhoyt/scandir/issues/19>`_]

* Avram L: "I'm testing our scandir for a project I'm working on.
  Seems pretty solid, so first thing, just want to say nice work!"
  [via personal email]

Others have `requested a PyPI package`_ for it, which has been
created. See `PyPI package`_.

.. _`PyPI package`: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/scandir

GitHub stats don't mean too much, but scandir does have several
watchers, issues, forks, etc. Here's the run-down as of the stats as
of June 5, 2014:

* Watchers: 17
* Stars: 48
* Forks: 15
* Issues: 2 open, 19 closed

**However, the much larger point is this:**, if this PEP is accepted,
``os.walk()`` can easily be reimplemented using ``scandir`` rather
than ``listdir`` and ``stat``, increasing the speed of ``os.walk()``
very significantly. There are thousands of developers, scripts, and
production code that would benefit from this large speedup of
``os.walk()``. For example, on GitHub, there are almost as many uses
of ``os.walk`` (194,000) as there are of ``os.mkdir`` (230,000).


Open issues and optional things
===============================

There are a few open issues or optional additions:


Should scandir be in its own module?
------------------------------------

Should the function be included in the standard library in a new
module, ``scandir.scandir()``, or just as ``os.scandir()`` as
discussed? The preference of this PEP's author (Ben Hoyt) would be
``os.scandir()``, as it's just a single function.


Should there be a way to access the full path?
----------------------------------------------

Should ``DirEntry``'s have a way to get the full path without using
``os.path.join(path, entry.name)``? This is a pretty common pattern,
and it may be useful to add pathlib-like ``str(entry)`` functionality.
This functionality has also been requested in `issue 13`_ on GitHub.

.. _`issue 13`: https://github.com/benhoyt/scandir/issues/13


Should it expose Windows wildcard functionality?
------------------------------------------------

Should ``scandir()`` have a way of exposing the wildcard functionality
in the Windows ``FindFirstFile`` / ``FindNextFile`` functions? The
scandir module on GitHub exposes this as a ``windows_wildcard``
keyword argument, allowing Windows power users the option to pass a
custom wildcard to ``FindFirstFile``, which may avoid the need to use
``fnmatch`` or similar on the resulting names. It is named the
unwieldly ``windows_wildcard`` to remind you you're writing power-
user, Windows-only code if you use it.

This boils down to whether ``scandir`` should be about exposing all of
the system's directory iteration features, or simply providing a fast,
simple, cross-platform directory iteration API.

This PEP's author votes for not including ``windows_wildcard`` in the
standard library version, because even though it could be useful in
rare cases (say the Windows Dropbox client?), it'd be too easy to use
it just because you're a Windows developer, and create code that is
not cross-platform.


Possible improvements
=====================

There are many possible improvements one could make to scandir, but
here is a short list of some this PEP's author has in mind:

* scandir could potentially be further sped up by calling ``readdir``
  / ``FindNextFile`` say 50 times per ``Py_BEGIN_ALLOW_THREADS`` block
  so that it stays in the C extension module for longer, and may be
  somewhat faster as a result. This approach hasn't been tested, but
  was suggested by on Issue 11406 by Antoine Pitrou.
