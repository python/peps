Abstract
========

This PEP proposed a list of standard library modules to be removed from the
standard library. The modules are mostly historic data formats and APIs that
have been superseded a long time ago, e.g. Mac OS 9 and Commodore.


Rationale
=========

Back in the early days of Python, the interpreter came with a large set of
useful modules. This was often referred to as "batteries included"
philosophy and was one of the corner stones to Python's success story.
Users didn't have to figure out how to download and install separate
packages in order to write a simple web server or parse email.

Times have changed. The introduction of the cheese shop (PyPI), setuptools,
and later pip, it became simple and straight forward to download and install
packages. Nowadays Python has a rich and vibrant ecosystem of third party
packages. It's pretty much standard to either install packages from PyPI or
use one of the many Python or Linux distributions.

On the other hand, Python's standard library is piling up cruft, unnecessary
duplication of functionality, and dispensable features. This is undesirable
for several reasons.

* Any additional module increases the maintenance cost for the Python core
  development team. The team has limited resources, reduced maintenance cost
  frees development time for other improvements.
* Modules in the standard library are generally favored and seen as the
  de facto solution for a problem. A majority of users only pick 3rd party
  modules to replace a stdlib module, when they have a compelling reason, e.g.
  lxml instead of `xml`. The removal of an unmaintained stdlib module
  increases the chances of a community contributed module to become widely
  used.
* A lean and mean standard library benefits platforms with limited resources
  like devices with just a few hundred kilobyte of storage (e.g. BBC
  Micro:bit). Python on mobile platforms like BeeWare or WebAssembly
  (e.g. pyodide) also benefit from reduced download size.

The modules in the PEP have been selected for deprecation because their
removal is either least controversial or most beneficial. For example
least controversial are 30 years old multimedia formats like ``sunau``
audio format, which was used on SPARC and NeXT workstations in the late
1980ties. The ``crypt`` module has fundamental flaws that are better solved
outside the standard library.

This PEP also designates some modules as not scheduled for removal. Some
modules have been deprecated for several releases or seem unnecessary at
first glance. However it is beneficial to keep the modules in the standard
library, mostly for environments where installing a package from PyPI is not
an option. This can be corporate environments or class rooms where external
code is not permitted without legal approval.

* The usage of FTP is declining, but some files are still provided over
  the FTP protocol or hosters offer FTP to upload content. Therefore
  ``ftplib`` is going to stay.
* The ``optparse`` and ``getopt`` module are widely used. They are mature
  modules with very low maintenance overhead.
* According to David Beazley [5]_ the ``wave`` module is easy to teach to
  kids and can make crazy sounds. Making a computer generate crazy sounds is
  powerful and highly motivating exercise for a 9yo aspiring developer. It's
  a fun battery to keep.


Deprecation schedule
====================

3.8
---

This PEP targets Python 3.8. Version 3.8.0 final is scheduled to be released
a few months before Python 2.7 will reach its end of lifetime. We expect that
Python 3.8 will be targeted by users that migrate to Python 3 in 2019 and
2020. To reduce churn and to allow a smooth transition from Python 2,
Python 3.8 will neither raise `DeprecationWarning` nor remove any
modules that have been scheduled for removal. Instead deprecated modules will
just be *documented* as deprecated. Optionally modules may emit a
`PendingDeprecationWarning`.

All deprecated modules will also undergo a feature freeze. No additional
features should be added. Bug should still be fixed.

3.9
---

Starting with Python 3.9, deprecated modules will start issuing
`DeprecationWarning`. The `parser`_ module is removed and potentially
replaced with a new module.

All other deprecated modules are fully supported and will receive security
updates until Python 3.9 reaches its end of lifetime. Python 3.9.0 will
be released about 18 months after 3.8.0 (April 2021?) and most likely
be supported for 5 years after the release. The estimated EOL of Python 3.9
is in 2026.

3.10
----

In 3.10 all deprecated modules will be removed from the CPython repository
together with tests, documentation, and autoconf rules.


PEP acceptance process
======================

3.8.0b1 is scheduled to be release shortly after the PEP is officially
submitted. Since it's improbable that the PEP will pass all stages of the
PEP process in time, I propose a two step acceptance process that is
analogous Python's two release deprecation process.

The first *provisionally accepted* phase targets Python 3.8.0b1. In the first
phase no code is changes or removed. Modules are only documented as
deprecated. The only exception is the `parser`_ module. It has been
documented as deprecated since Python 2.5 and is scheduled for removal for
3.9 to make place for a more advanced parser.

The final decision, which modules will be removed and how the removed code
is preserved, can be delayed for another year.


Deprecated modules
==================

The modules are grouped as data encoding, multimedia, network, OS interface,
and misc modules. The majority of modules are for old data formats or
old APIs. Some others are rarely useful and have better replacements on
PyPI, e.g. Pillow for image processing or NumPy-based projects to deal with
audio processing.

ossaudiodev
~~~~~~~~~~~

The `ossaudiodev <https://docs.python.org/3/library/ossaudiodev.html>`_
module provides support for Open Sound System, an interface to sound
playback and capture devices. OSS was initially free software, but later
support for newer sound devices and improvements were proprietary. Linux
community abandoned OSS in favor of ALSA [1]_. Some operation systems like
OpenBSD and NetBSD provide an incomplete [2]_ emulation of OSS.

Networking modules
------------------

asynchat
~~~~~~~~

The `asynchat <https://docs.python.org/3/library/asynchat.html>`_ module
is build on top of `asyncore`_ and has been deprecated since Python 3.6.

asyncore
~~~~~~~~

The `asyncore <https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncore.html>`_ module was
the first module for asynchronous socket service clients and servers. It
has been replaced by asyncio and is deprecated since Python 3.6.

The ``asyncore`` module is also used in stdlib tests. The tests for
``ftplib``, ``logging``, ``smptd``, ``smtplib``, and ``ssl`` are partly
based on ``asyncore``. These tests must be updated to use asyncio or
threading.

cgi
~~~

The `cgi <https://docs.python.org/3/library/cgi.html>`_ module is a support
module for Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scripts. CGI is deemed as
inefficient because every incoming request is handled in a new process. PEP
206 considers the module as *designed poorly and are now near-impossible
to fix*.

Several people proposed to either keep the cgi module for features like
`cgi.parse_qs()` or move `cgi.escape()` to a different module. The
functions `cgi.parse_qs` and `cgi.parse_qsl` have been
deprecated for a while and are actually aliases for
`urllib.parse.parse_qs` and `urllib.parse.parse_qsl`. The
function `cgi.quote` has been deprecated in favor of `html.quote`
with secure default values.

cgitb
~~~~~

The `cgitb <https://docs.python.org/3/library/cgitb.html>`_ module is a
helper for the cgi module for configurable tracebacks.

The ``cgitb`` module is not used by any major Python web framework (Django,
Pyramid, Plone, Flask, CherryPy, or Bottle). Only Paste uses it in an
optional debugging middleware.

smtpd
~~~~~

The `smtpd <https://docs.python.org/3/library/smtpd.html>`_ module provides
a simple implementation of a SMTP mail server. The module documentation
marks the module as deprecated and recommends ``aiosmtpd`` instead. The
deprecation message was added in releases 3.4.7, 3.5.4, and 3.6.1.

nntplib
~~~~~~~

The `nntplib <https://docs.python.org/3/library/nntplib.html>`_ module
implements the client side of the Network News Transfer Protocol (nntp). News
groups used to be a dominant platform for online discussions. Over the last
two decades, news has been slowly but steadily replaced with mailing lists
and web-based discussion platforms. Twisted is also
`planning <https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/9405>`_ to deprecate NNTP
support and `pynntp <https://github.com/greenbender/pynntp>`_ hasn't seen any
activity since 2014. This is a good indicator that the public interest in
NNTP support is declining.

The ``nntplib`` tests have been the cause of additional work in the recent
past. Python only contains client side of NNTP. The tests connect to
external news server. The servers are sometimes unavailable, too slow, or do
not work correctly over IPv6. The situation causes flaky test runs on
buildbots.

Operating system interface
--------------------------

crypt
~~~~~

The `crypt <https://docs.python.org/3/library/crypt.html>`_ module implements
password hashing based on ``crypt(3)`` function from ``libcrypt`` or
``libxcrypt`` on Unix-like platform. The algorithms are mostly old, of poor
quality and insecure. Users are discouraged to use them.

* The module is not available on Windows. Cross-platform application need
  an alternative implementation any way.
* Only DES encryption is guaranteed to be available. DES has an extremely
  limited key space of 2**56.
* MD5, salted SHA256, salted SHA512, and Blowfish are optional extension.
  SSHA256 and SSHA512 are glibc extensions. Blowfish (bcrypt) is the only
  algorithm that is still secure. However it's in glibc and therefore not
  commonly available on Linux.
* Depending on the platform, the ``crypt`` module is not thread safe. Only
  implementations with ``crypt_r(3)`` are thread safe.
* The module was never useful to interact with system user and password
  databases. On BSD, macOS, and Linux, all user authentication and
  password modification operations must go through PAM (pluggable
  authentication module), see `spwd`_ deprecation.

nis
~~~

The `nis <https://docs.python.org/3/library/nis.html>`_ module provides
NIS/YP support. Network Information Service / Yellow Pages is an old and
deprecated directory service protocol developed by Sun Microsystems. It's
designed successor NIS+ from 1992 never took off. For a long time, libc's
Name Service Switch, LDAP, and Kerberos/GSSAPI are considered a more powerful
and more secure replacement of NIS.

spwd
~~~~

The `spwd <https://docs.python.org/3/library/spwd.html>`_ module provides
direct access to Unix shadow password database using non-standard APIs.

In general it's a bad idea to use the spwd. The spwd circumvents system
security policies, it does not use the PAM stack, and is only compatible
with local user accounts, because it ignores NSS. The use of the ``spwd``
module for access control must be consider a *security bug*, as it bypasses
PAM's access control.

Further more the ``spwd`` module uses the
`shadow(3) <http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/shadow.3.html>`_ APIs.
Functions like ``getspnam(3)`` access the ``/etc/shadow`` file directly. This
is dangerous and even forbidden for confined services on systems with a
security engine like SELinux or AppArmor.

predecessor of the
`importlib <https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html>`_ module. Most
functions have been deprecated since Python 3.3 and the module since
Python 3.4.

msilib
~~~~~~

The `msilib <https://docs.python.org/3/library/msilib.html>`_ package is a
Windows-only package. It supports the creation of Microsoft Installers (MSI).
The package also exposes additional APIs to create cabinet files (CAB). The
module is used to facilitate distutils to create MSI installers with
``bdist_msi`` command. In the past it was used to create CPython's official
Windows installer, too.

Microsoft is slowly moving away from MSI in favor of Windows 10 Apps (AppX)
as new deployment model [3]_.

parser
~~~~~~

The `parser <https://docs.python.org/3/library/parser.html>`_ module provides
an interface to Python’s internal parser and byte-code compiler. The stdlib
has superior ways to interact with the parse tree. From Python 2.5 onward,
it's much more convenient to cut in at the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
generation and compilation stage.

The ``parser`` module causes additional work. It's C code that must be
kept in sync with any change to Python's grammar and internal parser.
Pablo wants to remove the parser module and promote lib2to3's pgen2 instead
[6]_.

Most importantly the presence of the ``parser`` module makes it harder to
switch to something more powerful than a LL(1) parser [7]_. Since the
``parser`` module is documented as deprecated since Python 2.5 and a new
parsing technology is planned for 3.9, the ``parser`` module is scheduled for
removal in 3.9.

pipes
~~~~~

The `pipes <https://docs.python.org/3/library/pipes.html>`_ module provides
helpers to pipe the input of one command into the output of another command.
The module is built on top of ``os.popen``. Users are encouraged to use
the subprocess module instead.

fpectl
------

The `fpectl <https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/fpectl.html>`_ module was
never built by default, its usage was discouraged and considered dangerous.
It also required a configure flag that caused an ABI incompatibility. The
module was removed in 3.7 by Nathaniel J. Smith in
`bpo-29137 <https://bugs.python.org/issue29137>`_.

Modules to keep
===============

Some modules were originally proposed for deprecation.

    optparse,**3.2**,argparse
    wave,\-,

colorsys
--------

The `colorsys <https://docs.python.org/3/library/colorsys.html>`_ module
defines color conversion functions between RGB, YIQ, HSL, and HSV coordinate
systems.

Walter Dörwald, Petr Viktorin, and others requested to keep ``colorsys``. The
module is useful to convert CSS colors between coordinate systems. The
implementation is simple, mature, and does not impose maintenance overhead
on core development.

The PyPI packages *colormath*, *colour*, and *colorspacious* provide more and
advanced features. The Pillow library is better suited to transform images
between color systems.

  `Pillow <https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/>`_

fileinput
---------

The `fileinput <https://docs.python.org/3/library/fileinput.html>`_ module
implements a helpers to iterate over a list of files from ``sys.argv``. The
module predates the optparse and argparse module. The same functionality
can be implemented with the argparse module.

Several core developers expressed their interest to keep the module in the
standard library, as it is handy for quick scripts.

Module type
  pure Python
Has a designated expert
   no

lib2to3
-------

The `lib2to3 <https://docs.python.org/3/library/2to3.html>`_ package provides
the ``2to3`` command to transpile Python 2 code to Python 3 code.

The package is useful for other tasks besides porting code from Python 2 to
3. For example `black`_ uses it for code reformatting.

Module type
  pure Python
Has a designated expert
   no

getopt
------

The `getopt <https://docs.python.org/3/library/getopt.html>`_ module mimics
C's getopt() option parser.

Although users are encouraged to use argparse instead, the getopt module is
still widely used. The module is small, simple, and handy for C developers
to write simple Python scripts.

Module type
  pure Python
Has a designated expert
   no
Substitute
  argparse

optparse
--------

The `optparse <https://docs.python.org/3/library/optparse.html>`_ module is
the predecessor of the argparse module.

Although it has been deprecated for many years, it's still too widely used
to remove it.

Module type
  pure Python
Deprecated in
  3.2
Has a designated expert
   yes
Substitute
  argparse

wave
----

The `wave <https://docs.python.org/3/library/wave.html>`_ module provides
support for the WAV sound format.

The module is not deprecated, because The WAV format is still relevant these
days. The ``wave`` module is also used in education, e.g. to show kids how
to make noise with a computer.

The module uses one simple function from the `audioop`_ module to perform
byte swapping between little and big endian formats. Before 24 bit WAV
support was added, byte swap used to be implemented with the ``array``
module. To remove ``wave``'s dependency on the ``audioop``, the byte swap
function could be either be moved to another module (e.g. ``operator``) or
the ``array`` module could gain support for 24 bit (3 byte) arrays.

Module type
  pure Python (depends on *byteswap* from `audioop`_ C extension)
Has a designated expert
   no


Future maintenance of removed modules
=====================================

The main goal of the PEP is to reduce the burden and workload on the Python
core developer team. Therefore removed modules will not be maintained by
the core team as separate PyPI packages. However the removed code, tests and
documentation may be moved into a new git repository, so community members
have a place from which they can pick up and fork code.

A first draft of a `legacylib <https://github.com/tiran/legacylib>`_
repository is available on my private GitHub account. The modules could be
made available on PyPI. The Python core team will not publish or maintain
the packages. It is my hope that members of the Python community will
adopt, maintain, and perhaps improve the deprecated modules.

It's my hope that some of the deprecated modules will be picked up and
adopted by users that actually care about them. For example ``colorsys`` and
``imghdr`` are useful modules, but have limited feature set. A fork of
``imghdr`` can add new features and support for more image formats, without
being constrained by Python's release cycle.

Most of the modules are in pure Python and can be easily packaged. Some
depend on a simple C module, e.g. `audioop`_ and `crypt`_. Since `audioop`_
does not depend on any external libraries, it can be shipped in as binary
wheels with some effort. Other C modules can be replaced with ctypes or cffi.
For example I created `legacycrypt <https://github.com/tiran/legacycrypt>`_
with ``_crypt`` extension reimplemented with a few lines of ctypes code.


Discussions
===========

* Elana Hashman and Nick Coghlan suggested to keep the *getopt* module.
* Berker Peksag proposed to deprecate and removed *msilib*.
* Brett Cannon recommended to delay active deprecation warnings and removal
  of modules like *imp* until Python 3.10. Version 3.8 will be released
  shortly before Python 2 reaches end of lifetime. A delay reduced churn for
  users that migrate from Python 2 to 3.8.
* Brett also came up with the idea to keep lib2to3. The package is useful
  for other purposes, e.g. `black <https://pypi.org/project/black/>`_ uses
  it to reformat Python code.
* At one point, distutils was mentioned in the same sentence as this PEP.
  To avoid lengthy discussion and delay of the PEP, I decided against dealing
  with distutils. Deprecation of the distutils package will be handled by
  another PEP.
* Multiple people (Gregory P. Smith, David Beazley, Nick Coghlan, ...)
  convinced me to keep the `wave`_ module. [4]_
* Gregory P. Smith proposed to deprecate `nntplib`_. [4]_
* Andrew Svetlov mentioned the ``socketserver`` module is questionable.
  However it's used to implement ``http.server`` and ``xmlrpc.server``. The
  stdlib doesn't have a replacement for the servers, yet.


Update history
==============

Update 1
--------

* Deprecate `parser`_ module
* Keep `fileinput`_ module
* Elaborate why `crypt`_ and `spwd`_ are dangerous and bad
* Improve sections for `cgitb`_, `colorsys`_, `nntplib`_, and `smtpd`_ modules
* The `colorsys`_, `crypt`_, `imghdr`_, `sndhdr`_, and `spwd`_ sections now
  list suitable substitutions.
* Mention that ``socketserver`` is going to stay for ``http.server`` and
  ``xmlrpc.server``
* The future maintenance section now states that the deprecated modules
  may be adopted by Python community members.

Update 2
--------

* Keep ``colorsys`` module
* Add experts
* Redirect discussions to discuss.python.org
