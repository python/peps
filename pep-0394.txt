Abstract
========

This PEP provides a convention to ensure that Python scripts can continue to
be portable across ``*nix`` systems, regardless of the version of the Python
interpreter invoked by the ``python`` command.

* ``python2`` will refer to some version of Python 2.x.
* ``python3`` will refer to some version of Python 3.x.
* Distributions can choose whether ``python`` is installed and, if it is,
  whether it refers to the same target as ``python2`` or ``python3``.
* End users should be aware that the ``python`` command is inconsistent
  across Unix-like systems.
* In activated virtual environments, ``python`` always refers to the
  environment's Python version.
* Cross-platform scripts should prefer the ``python3`` shebang even if they
  support both Python 3 and Python 2.
* Cross-platform scripts only supporting Python 2 should use the ``python2``
  shebang.

Recommendation
==============

For distributors
----------------

* Unix-like software distributions (including systems like macOS and
  Cygwin) should install the ``python2`` command into the default path
  whenever a version of the Python 2 interpreter is installed, and the same
  for ``python3`` and the Python 3 interpreter.
* When  invoked, ``python2`` should run some version of the Python 2
  interpreter, and ``python3`` should run some version of the Python 3
  interpreter.
* If the ``python`` command is installed, it should either invoke the same
  version of Python as the ``python3`` command or as the ``python2``
  command.
* Distributors may choose to set the behavior of the ``python`` command,
  not provide it at all, or make it configurable by the user or
  system administrator.
* The Python 3.x ``idle``, ``pydoc``, and ``python-config`` commands should
  likewise be available as ``idle3``, ``pydoc3``, and ``python3-config``;
  Python 2.x versions as ``idle2``, ``pydoc2``, and ``python2-config``.
  The original commands should either invoke the same version of Python
  as the ``python`` command, or not be available at all.
* When packaging software, distributors are encouraged to change less specific
  shebangs to more specific ones. This ensures software is used with the latest
  version of Python available, and it can remove a dependency on Python 2.
  The specifics are left on the distributors.
  Examples of this include changing ``python`` shebangs to ``python3``
  when Python 3.x is supported, changing ``python`` shebangs to ``python2``
  when Python 3.x is not yet supported, or changing ``python3`` shebangs to
  ``python3.8`` if the software is built with Python 3.8.
* When a virtual environment (created by the PEP 405 ``venv`` package or a
  similar tool such as ``virtualenv`` or ``conda``) is active, the ``python``
  command should refer to the virtual environment's interpreter and should
  always be available.
  The ``python3`` or ``python2`` command (according to the environment's
  interpreter) should also be available.

For developers
--------------

* In order to tolerate differences across platforms, new code that needs
  to invoke the Python interpreter should not specify ``python``, but rather
  should specify either ``python3`` or ``python2`` (or the more specific
  ``python3.x`` and ``python2.x`` versions; see the `Migration Notes`_).
  This distinction should be made in shebangs, when invoking from a shell
  script, when invoking via the system() call, or when invoking in any other
  context.
* When reinvoking the interpreter from a Python script, querying
  ``sys.executable`` to avoid hardcoded assumptions regarding the
  interpreter location remains the preferred approach.
* Scripts that are deliberately written to be source compatible with both
  Python 3.x and 2.x should use ``python3`` on their shebang line
  (see `Rationale`_ for details).
* One exception to this is scripts that are deliberately written to be used
  on an “*old system*” where ``python3`` (or even ``python2``) is not available
  (such as the default Python installed on macOS or RHEL 6).
  Such scripts may continue to use ``python`` on their shebang line.
* Scripts targeting both “*old systems*” and systems without the default
  ``python`` command need to make a compromise and document this situation.
  Avoiding shebangs (via the console_scripts Entry Points ([9]_) or similar
  means) is the recommended workaround for this problem.
* Applications designed exclusively for a specific environment (such as
  a container or virtual environment) may continue to use the ``python``
  command name.

These recommendations are the outcome of the relevant python-dev discussions
in March and July 2011 ([1]_, [2]_), February 2012 ([4]_),
September 2014 ([6]_), discussion on GitHub in April 2018 ([7]_)
and on python-dev in February 2019 ([8]_).



History of this PEP
===================

In 2011, the majority of distributions
aliased the ``python`` command to Python 2, but some started switching it to
Python 3 ([5]_). As some of the former distributions did not provide a
``python2`` command by default, there was previously no way for Python 2 code
(or any code that invokes the Python 2 interpreter directly rather than via
``sys.executable``) to reliably run on all Unix-like systems without
modification, as the ``python`` command would invoke the wrong interpreter
version on some systems, and the ``python2`` command would fail completely
on others. This PEP originally provided a very simple mechanism
to restore cross-platform support, with minimal additional work required
on the part of distribution maintainers. Simplified, the recommendation was:

1. The ``python`` command was preferred for code compatible with both
   Python 2 and 3 (since it was available on all systems, even those that
   already aliased it to Python 3).
2. The ``python`` command should always invoke Python 2 (to prevent
   hard-to-diagnose errors when Python 2 code is run on Python 3).
3. The ``python2`` and ``python3`` commands should be available to specify
   the version explicitly.

However, these recommendations implicitly assumed that Python 2 would always be
available. As Python 2 is nearing its end of life in 2020 (PEP 373, PEP 404),
distributions are making Python 2 optional or removing it entirely.
This means either removing the ``python`` command or switching it to invoke
Python 3, invalidating respectively the first or second recommendation.
Also, some distributors decided that their users are better served by
ignoring the PEP's recommendations, making the PEP's nominally
cross-platform recommendations on ``python`` and ``python2`` in shebangs
increasingly unreliable.


.. _rationale:

Current Rationale
=================

As of 2019, nearly all new systems include Python 3 and the ``python3``
command. This makes the ``python3`` command the best general choice for
code that can run on either Python 3.x or 2.x, even though it is not
available everywhere.

The recommendation is skewed toward current and future systems, leaving
behind “*old systems*” (like RHEL 6 or default Python installed on macOS).
On these systems, Python software is rarely updated and any recommendations
this PEP makes would likely be ignored.

Also, since distributors often ignored recommendations the PEP gave
regarding the ``python`` command (for what they saw as legitimate special
needs), this PEP now gives them broad control over the command.
Correspondingly, users are advised to not use the ``python`` command
in cross-platform code.
Instead, this PEP specifies the expected behavior of the ``python3`` and
``python2`` commands, which is not controversial.


Future Changes to this Recommendation
=====================================

This recommendation will be periodically reviewed over the next few years,
and updated when the core development team judges it appropriate. As a
point of reference, regular maintenance releases for the Python 2.7 series
will continue until January 2020.


Migration Notes
===============

This section does not contain any official recommendations from the core
CPython developers. It's merely a collection of notes regarding various
aspects of migrating to Python 3 as the default version of Python for a
system. They will hopefully be helpful to any distributions considering
making such a change.

* The main barrier to a distribution switching the ``python`` command from
  ``python2`` to ``python3`` isn't breakage within the distribution, but
  instead breakage of private third party scripts developed by sysadmins
  and other users. Updating the ``python`` command to invoke ``python3``
  by default indicates that a distribution is willing to break such scripts
  with errors that are potentially quite confusing for users that aren't
  familiar with the backwards incompatible changes in Python 3. For
  example, while the change of ``print`` from a statement to a builtin
  function is relatively simple for automated converters to handle, the
  SyntaxError from attempting to use the Python 2 notation in Python 3
  may be confusing for users that are not aware of the change::

      $ python3 -c 'print "Hello, world!"'
        File "<string>", line 1
          print "Hello, world!"
                ^
      SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'. Did you mean print("Hello, world!")?

  While this might be obvious for experienced Pythonistas, such scripts
  might even be run by people who are not familiar with Python at all.
  Avoiding breakage of such third party scripts was the key reason this
  PEP used to recommend that ``python`` continue to refer to ``python2``.
* The error message ``python: command not found`` tends to be surprisingly
  actionable, even for people unfamiliar with Python.
* The ``pythonX.X`` (e.g. ``python3.6``) commands exist on modern systems, on
  which they invoke specific minor versions of the Python interpreter. It
  can be useful for distribution-specific packages to take advantage of these
  utilities if they exist, since it will prevent code breakage if the default
  minor version of a given major version is changed. However, scripts
  intending to be cross-platform should not rely on the presence of these
  utilities, but rather should be tested on several recent minor versions of
  the target major version, compensating, if necessary, for the small
  differences that exist between minor versions. This prevents the need for
  sysadmins to install many very similar versions of the interpreter.
* When the ``pythonX.X`` binaries are provided by a distribution, the
  ``python2`` and ``python3`` commands should refer to one of those files
  rather than being provided as a separate binary file.
* It is strongly encouraged that distribution-specific packages use ``python3``
  (or ``python2``) rather than ``python``, even in code that is not intended to
  operate on other distributions. This will reduce problems if the
  distribution later decides to change the version of the Python interpreter
  that the ``python`` command invokes, or if a sysadmin installs a custom
  ``python`` command with a different major version than the distribution
  default.
* If the above point is adhered to and sysadmins are permitted to change the
  ``python`` command, then the ``python`` command should always be implemented
  as a link to the interpreter binary (or a link to a link) and not vice
  versa. That way, if a sysadmin does decide to replace the installed
  ``python`` file, they can do so without inadvertently deleting the
  previously installed binary.
* Even as the Python 2 interpreter becomes less common, scripts should
  nevertheless continue to use the ``python3`` convention rather than just
  ``python``. In the event of a future Python 4.0 release, distributors may
  then choose to simply alias ``python3`` to the same binary as ``python4``
  (if the degree of change will be the same as in any other Python feature
  release), or else they may choose to maintain parallel ``python3`` and
  ``python4`` stacks for a time (depending on the needs of their specific
  audience).
* If these conventions are adhered to, it will become the case that the
  ``python`` command is only executed in an interactive manner as a user
  convenience, or else when using a virtual environment or similar mechanism.


Backwards Compatibility
=======================

A potential problem can arise if a script adhering to the
``python2``/``python3`` convention is executed on a system not supporting
these commands. This is mostly a non-issue, since the sysadmin can simply
create these symbolic links and avoid further problems. It is a significantly
more obvious breakage than the sometimes cryptic errors that can arise when
attempting to execute a script containing Python 2 specific syntax with a
Python 3 interpreter or vice versa.


Application to the CPython Reference Interpreter
================================================

While technically a new feature, the ``make install`` and ``make bininstall``
command in the 2.7 version of CPython were adjusted to create the
following chains of symbolic links in the relevant ``bin`` directory (the
final item listed in the chain is the actual installed binary, preceding
items are relative symbolic links)::

    python -> python2 -> python2.7
    python-config -> python2-config -> python2.7-config

Similar adjustments were made to the macOS binary installer.

This feature first appeared in the default installation process in
CPython 2.7.3.

The installation commands in the CPython 3.x series already create the
appropriate symlinks. For example, CPython 3.2 creates::

    python3 -> python3.2
    idle3 -> idle3.2
    pydoc3 -> pydoc3.2
    python3-config -> python3.2-config

And CPython 3.3 creates::

    python3 -> python3.3
    idle3 -> idle3.3
    pydoc3 -> pydoc3.3
    python3-config -> python3.3-config
    pysetup3 -> pysetup3.3

The implementation progress of these features in the default installers was
managed on the tracker as issue #12627 ([3]_).


Impact on PYTHON* Environment Variables
=======================================

The choice of target for the ``python`` command implicitly affects a
distribution's expected interpretation of the various Python related
environment variables. The use of ``*.pth`` files in the relevant
``site-packages`` folder, the "per-user site packages" feature (see
``python -m site``) or more flexible tools such as ``virtualenv`` are all more
tolerant of the presence of multiple versions of Python on a system than the
direct use of ``PYTHONPATH``.


Exclusion of MS Windows
=======================

This PEP deliberately excludes any proposals relating to Microsoft Windows, as
devising an equivalent solution for Windows was deemed too complex to handle
here. PEP 397 and the related discussion on the python-dev mailing list
address this issue.
