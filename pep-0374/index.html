<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#rationale" role="doc-backlink">Rationale</a></h2>
<p>Python has been using a centralized version control system (VCS;
first CVS, now Subversion) for years to great effect. Having a master
copy of the official version of Python provides people with a single
place to always get the official Python source code. It has also
allowed for the storage of the history of the language, mostly for
help with development, but also for posterity. And of course the V in
VCS is very helpful when developing.</p>
<p>But a centralized version control system has its drawbacks. First and
foremost, in order to have the benefits of version control with
Python in a seamless fashion, one must be a “core developer” (i.e.
someone with commit privileges on the master copy of Python). People
who are not core developers but who wish to work with Python’s
revision tree, e.g. anyone writing a patch for Python or creating a
custom version, do not have direct tool support for revisions. This
can be quite a limitation, since these non-core developers cannot
easily do basic tasks such as reverting changes to a previously
saved state, creating branches, publishing one’s changes with full
revision history, etc. For non-core developers, the last safe tree
state is one the Python developers happen to set, and this prevents
safe development. This second-class citizenship is a hindrance to
people who wish to contribute to Python with a patch of any
complexity and want a way to incrementally save their progress to
make their development lives easier.</p>
<p>There is also the issue of having to be online to be able to commit
one’s work. Because centralized VCSs keep a central copy that stores
all revisions, one must have Internet access in order for their
revisions to be stored; no Net, no commit. This can be annoying if
you happen to be traveling and lack any Internet. There is also the
situation of someone wishing to contribute to Python but having a
bad Internet connection where committing is time-consuming and
expensive and it might work out better to do it in a single step.</p>
<p>Another drawback to a centralized VCS is that a common use case is
for a developer to revise patches in response to review comments.
This is more difficult with a centralized model because there’s no
place to contain intermediate work. It’s either all checked in or
none of it is checked in. In the centralized VCS, it’s also very
difficult to track changes to the trunk as they are committed, while
you’re working on your feature or bug fix branch. This increases
the risk that such branches will grow stale, out-dated, or that
merging them into the trunk will generate too may conflicts to be
easily resolved.</p>
<p>Lastly, there is the issue of maintenance of Python. At any one time
there is at least one major version of Python under development (at
the time of this writing there are two). For each major version of
Python under development there is at least the maintenance version
of the last minor version and the in-development minor version (e.g.
with 2.6 just released, that means that both 2.6 and 2.7 are being
worked on). Once a release is done, a branch is created between the
code bases where changes in one version do not (but could) belong in
the other version. As of right now there is no natural support for
this branch in time in central VCSs; you must use tools that
simulate the branching. Tracking merges is similarly painful for
developers, as revisions often need to be merged between four active
branches (e.g. 2.6 maintenance, 3.0 maintenance, 2.7 development,
3.1 development). In this case, VCSs such as Subversion only handle
this through arcane third party tools.</p>
<p>Distributed VCSs (DVCSs) solve all of these problems. While one can
keep a master copy of a revision tree, anyone is free to copy that
tree for their own use. This gives everyone the power to commit
changes to their copy, online or offline. It also more naturally
ties into the idea of branching in the history of a revision tree
for maintenance and the development of new features bound for
Python. DVCSs also provide a great many additional features that
centralized VCSs don’t or can’t provide.</p>
<p>This PEP explores the possibility of changing Python’s use of Subversion
to any of the currently popular  DVCSs, in order to gain
the benefits outlined above. This PEP does not guarantee that a switch
to a DVCS will occur at the conclusion of this PEP. It is quite
possible that no clear winner will be found and that svn will continue
to be used. If this happens, this PEP will be revisited and revised in
the future as the state of DVCSs evolves.</p>
</section>
<section id="terminology">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#terminology" role="doc-backlink">Terminology</a></h2>
<p>Agreeing on a common terminology is surprisingly difficult,
primarily because each VCS uses these terms when describing subtly
different tasks, objects, and concepts. Where possible, we try to
provide a generic definition of the concepts, but you should consult
the individual system’s glossaries for details. Here are some basic
references for terminology, from some of the standard web-based
references on each VCS. You can also refer to glossaries for each
DVCS:</p>

<section id="typical-workflow">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#typical-workflow" role="doc-backlink">Typical Workflow</a></h2>
<p>At the moment, the typical workflow for a Python core developer is:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Edit code in a checkout until it is stable enough to commit/push.</li>
<li>Commit to the master repository.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is a rather simple workflow, but it has drawbacks. For one,
because any work that involves the repository takes time thanks to
the network, commits/pushes tend to not necessarily be as atomic as
possible. There is also the drawback of there not being a
necessarily cheap way to create new checkouts beyond a recursive
copy of the checkout directory.</p>
<p>A DVCS would lead to a workflow more like this:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Branch off of a local clone of the master repository.</li>
<li>Edit code, committing in atomic pieces.</li>
<li>Merge the branch into the mainline, and</li>
<li>Push all commits to the master repository.</li>
</ul>
<p>While there are more possible steps, the workflow is much more
independent of the master repository than is currently possible. By
being able to commit locally at the speed of your disk, a core
developer is able to do atomic commits much more frequently,
minimizing having commits that do multiple things to the code. Also
by using a branch, the changes are isolated (if desired) from other
changes being made by other developers. Because branches are cheap,
it is easy to create and maintain many smaller branches that address
one specific issue, e.g. one bug or one new feature. More
sophisticated features of DVCSs allow the developer to more easily
track long running development branches as the official mainline
progresses.</p>

<p>This PEP does not consider darcs, arch, or monotone. The main
problem with these DVCSs is that they are simply not popular enough
to bother supporting when they do not provide some very compelling
features that the other DVCSs provide. Arch and darcs also have
significant performance problems which seem unlikely to be addressed
in the near future.</p>

<section id="interoperability">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#interoperability" role="doc-backlink">Interoperability</a></h2>
<p>For those who have already decided which DVCSs they want to use, and
are willing to maintain local mirrors themselves, all three DVCSs
support interchange via the git “fast-import” changeset format.  git
does so natively, of course, and native support for Bazaar is under
active development, and getting good early reviews as of mid-February
2009.  Mercurial has idiosyncratic support for importing via its <em>hg
convert</em> command, and <a class="reference external" href="http://repo.or.cz/r/fast-export.git/.git/description">third-party fast-import support</a> is available
for exporting.  Also, the <a class="reference external" href="http://progetti.arstecnica.it/tailor/">Tailor</a> tool supports automatic maintenance
of mirrors based on an official repository in any of the candidate
formats with a local mirror in any format.</p>
</section>
<section id="usage-scenarios">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#usage-scenarios" role="doc-backlink">Usage Scenarios</a></h2>
<p>Probably the best way to help decide on whether/which DVCS should
replace Subversion is to see what it takes to perform some
real-world usage scenarios that developers (core and non-core) have
to work with. Each usage scenario outlines what it is, a bullet list
of what the basic steps are (which can vary slightly per VCS), and
how to perform the usage scenario in the various VCSs
(including Subversion).</p>
<p>Each VCS had a single author in charge of writing implementations
for each scenario (unless otherwise noted).</p>

<section id="initial-setup">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#initial-setup" role="doc-backlink">Initial Setup</a></h3>
<p>Some DVCSs have some perks if you do some initial setup upfront.
This section covers what can be done before any of the usage
scenarios are run in order to take better advantage of the tools.</p>
<p>All of the DVCSs support configuring your project identification.
Unlike the centralized systems, they use your email address to
identify your commits. (Access control is generally done by
mechanisms external to the DVCS, such as ssh or console login).

<section id="bzr">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#bzr" role="doc-backlink">bzr</a></h4>
<p>No setup is required, but for much quicker and space-efficient local
branching, you should create a shared repository to hold all your
Python branches. A shared repository is really just a parent
directory containing a .bzr directory. When bzr commits a revision,
it searches from the local directory on up the file system for a .bzr
directory to hold the revision. By sharing revisions across multiple
branches, you cut down on the amount of disk space used. Do this:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">cd</span> <span class="o">~/</span><span class="n">projects</span>
<span class="n">bzr</span> <span class="n">init</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">repo</span> <span class="n">python</span>
<span class="n">cd</span> <span class="n">python</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Now, all your Python branches should be created inside of
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">~/projects/python</span></code>.</p>
<p>There are also some settings you can put in your
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">~/.bzr/bazaar.conf</span></code>
and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">~/.bzr/locations.conf</span></code> file to set up defaults for interacting
with Python code. None of them are required, although some are
recommended. E.g. I would suggest gpg signing all commits, but that
might be too high a barrier for developers. Also, you can set up
default push locations depending on where you want to push branches
by default. If you have write access to the master branches, that
push location could be code.python.org. Otherwise, it might be a
free Bazaar code hosting service such as Launchpad. If Bazaar is
chosen, we should decide what the policies and recommendations are.</p>
<p>At a minimum, I would set up your email address:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">bzr</span> <span class="n">whoami</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Firstname Lastname &lt;email.address@example.com&gt;&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>As with hg and git below, there are ways to set your email address (or really,
just about any parameter) on a
per-repository basis.  You do this with settings in your
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">$HOME/.bazaar/locations.conf</span></code> file, which has an ini-style format as does
the other DVCSs.  See the Bazaar documentation for details,
which mostly aren’t relevant for this discussion.</p>
</section>
<section id="hg">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#hg" role="doc-backlink">hg</a></h4>
<p>Minimally, you should set your user name. To do so, create the file
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.hgrc</span></code> in your home directory and add the following:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">ui</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="n">username</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Firstname</span> <span class="n">Lastname</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">email</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">address</span><span class="nd">@example</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">com</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If you are using Windows and your tools do not support Unix-style newlines,
you can enable automatic newline translation by adding to your configuration:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">extensions</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="n">win32text</span> <span class="o">=</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>These options can also be set locally to a given repository by
customizing <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;repo&gt;/.hg/hgrc</span></code>, instead of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">~/.hgrc</span></code>.</p>
</section>

<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id1" role="doc-backlink">git</a></h4>
<p>None needed. However, git supports a number of features that can
smooth your work, with a little preparation. git supports setting
defaults at the workspace, user, and system levels. The system
level is out of scope of this PEP. The user configuration file is
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">$HOME/.gitconfig</span></code> on Unix-like systems, and the workspace
configuration file is <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">$REPOSITORY/.git/config</span></code>.</p>
<p>You can use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git-config</span></code> tool to set preferences for user.name and
user.email either globally (for your system login account) or
locally (to a given git working copy), or you can edit the
configuration files (which have the same format as shown in the
Mercurial section above).:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># my full name doesn&#39;t change</span>
<span class="c1"># note &quot;--global&quot; flag means per user</span>
<span class="c1"># (system-wide configuration is set with &quot;--system&quot;)</span>
<span class="n">git</span> <span class="n">config</span> <span class="o">--</span><span class="k">global</span> <span class="n">user</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">name</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Firstname Lastname&#39;</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If you are using Windows, you probably want to set the core.autocrlf
and core.safecrlf preferences to true using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git-config</span></code>.:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># check out files with CRLF line endings rather than Unix-style LF only</span>
<span class="n">git</span> <span class="n">config</span> <span class="o">--</span><span class="k">global</span> <span class="n">core</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">autocrlf</span> <span class="n">true</span>
<span class="c1"># scream if a transformation would be ambiguous</span>
<span class="c1"># (eg, a working file contains both naked LF and CRLF)</span>
<span class="c1"># and check them back in with the reverse transformation</span>
<span class="n">git</span> <span class="n">config</span> <span class="o">--</span><span class="k">global</span> <span class="n">core</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">safecrlf</span> <span class="n">true</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Although the repository will usually contain a .gitignore file
specifying file names that rarely if ever should be registered in the
VCS, you may have personal conventions (e.g., always editing log
messages in a temporary file named “.msg”) that you may wish to
specify.:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># tell git where my personal ignores are</span>
<span class="n">git</span> <span class="n">config</span> <span class="o">--</span><span class="k">global</span> <span class="n">core</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">excludesfile</span> <span class="o">~/.</span><span class="n">gitignore</span>
<span class="c1"># I use .msg for my long commit logs, and Emacs makes backups in</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If you use multiple branches, as with the other VCSes, you can save a
lot of space by putting all objects in a common object store. This
also can save download time, if the origins of the branches were in
different repositories, because objects are shared across branches in
your repository even if they were not present in the upstream
repositories.  git is very space- and time-efficient and applies a
number of optimizations automatically, so this configuration is
optional.  (Examples are omitted.)</p>

<p>Subversion does not exactly fit into this development style very well
as there are no such thing as a “branch” as has been defined in this
PEP. Instead a developer either needs to create another checkout for
testing a patch or create a branch on the server. Up to this point,
core developers have not taken the “branch on the server” approach to
dealing with individual patches. For this scenario the assumption
will be the developer creates a local checkout of the trunk to work

<p>Alternatively, since you’re probably going to commit these changes to
the trunk, you could just do a checkout. That would give you a local
working tree while the branch (i.e. all revisions) would continue to

you to more quickly review the patch. There’s no need for the push

<p>As a core developer, I want to apply a patch to 2.6, 2.7, 3.0, and 3.1
so that I can fix a problem in all three versions.</p>
<p>Thanks to always having the cutting-edge and the latest release
version under development, Python currently has four branches being
worked on simultaneously. That makes it important for a change to
propagate easily through various branches.</p>

<p>Because of Python’s use of svnmerge, changes start with the trunk
(2.7) and then get merged to the release version of 2.6. To get the
change into the 3.x series, the change is merged into 3.1, fixed up,
and then merged into 3.0 (2.7 -&gt; 2.6; 2.7 -&gt; 3.1 -&gt; 3.0).</p>
<p>This is in contrast to a port-forward strategy where the patch would
have been added to 2.6 and then pulled forward into newer versions

<p>Mercurial, like other DVCS, does not well support the current
workflow used by Python core developers to backport patches. Right
now, bug fixes are first applied to the development mainline
(i.e., trunk), then back-ported to the maintenance branches and
forward-ported, as necessary, to the py3k branch. This workflow
requires the ability to cherry-pick individual changes. Mercurial’s
transplant extension provides this ability. Here is an example of
the scenario using this workflow:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">cd</span> <span class="n">release26</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">maint</span>
<span class="c1"># Assume patch applied to 2.7 in revision 0000</span>
<span class="n">hg</span> <span class="n">transplant</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">s</span> <span class="o">../</span><span class="n">trunk</span> <span class="mi">0000</span>
<span class="c1"># Resolve conflicts, if any.</span>
<span class="n">cd</span> <span class="o">../</span><span class="n">py3k</span>
<span class="n">hg</span> <span class="n">pull</span> <span class="o">../</span><span class="n">trunk</span>
<span class="n">hg</span> <span class="n">merge</span>
<span class="n">hg</span> <span class="n">revert</span> <span class="n">Misc</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">NEWS</span>
<span class="n">hg</span> <span class="n">commit</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">m</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Merged trunk&quot;</span>
<span class="n">hg</span> <span class="n">push</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In the above example, transplant acts much like the current svnmerge
command. When transplant is invoked without the revision, the command
launches an interactive loop useful for transplanting multiple
changes. Another useful feature is the –filter option which can be
used to modify changesets programmatically (e.g., it could be used
for removing changes to Misc/NEWS automatically).</p>
<p>Alternatively to the traditional workflow, we could avoid
transplanting changesets by committing bug fixes to the oldest
supported release, then merge these fixes upward to the more recent
branches.</p>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Although this approach makes the history non-linear and slightly
more difficult to follow, it encourages fixing bugs across all
supported releases. Furthermore, it scales better when there is many
changes to backport, because we do not need to seek the specific
revision IDs to merge.</p>

<p>If you are regularly merging (rather than cherry-picking) from a
given branch, then you can block a given commit from being
accidentally merged in the future by merging, then reverting it.
This does not prevent a cherry-pick from pulling in the unwanted
patch, and this technique requires blocking everything that you don’t
want merged. I’m not sure if this differs from svn on this point.</p>

<p>Sometimes core developers end up working on a major feature with
several developers. As a core developer, I want to be able to
publish feature branches to a common public location so that I can
collaborate with other developers.</p>
<p>This requires creating a branch on a server that other developers
can access. All of the DVCSs support creating new repositories on
hosts where the developer is already able to commit, with
appropriate configuration of the repository host. This is
similar in concept to the existing sandbox in svn, although details
of repository initialization may differ.</p>
<p>For non-core developers, there are various more-or-less public-access
repository-hosting services.
Bazaar has
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.launchpad.net/">Launchpad</a>,
Mercurial has
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.bitbucket.org/">bitbucket.org</a>,
and git has
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.github.com/">GitHub</a>.
All also have easy-to-use
CGI interfaces for developers who maintain their own servers.</p>

<p>Sometimes, while working on an issue, it becomes apparent that the
problem being worked on is actually a compound issue of various
smaller issues. Being able to take the current work and then begin
working on a separate issue is very helpful to separate out issues
into individual units of work instead of compounding them into a
single, large unit.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Create a branch A (e.g. urllib has a bug).</li>
<li>Edit some code.</li>
<li>Create a new branch B that branch A depends on (e.g. the urllib
bug exposes a socket bug).</li>
<li>Edit some code in branch B.</li>
<li>Commit branch B.</li>
<li>Edit some code in branch A.</li>
<li>Commit branch A.</li>
<li>Clean up.</li>

<p>To make up for svn’s lack of cheap branching, it has a changelist
option to associate a file with a single changelist. This is not as
powerful as being able to associate at the commit level. There is
also no way to express dependencies between changelists.</p>

<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id20" role="doc-backlink">bzr</a></h4>
<p>Here’s an approach that uses bzr shelf (now a standard part of bzr)
to squirrel away some changes temporarily while you take a detour to
fix the socket bugs.</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">bzr</span> <span class="n">branch</span> <span class="n">trunk</span> <span class="n">bug</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">0000</span>

<span class="n">bzr</span> <span class="n">unshelve</span>
<span class="c1"># Edit some code</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Another approach uses the loom plugin. Looms can
greatly simplify working on dependent branches because they
automatically take care of the stacking dependencies for you.
Imagine looms as a stack of dependent branches (called “threads” in
loom parlance), with easy ways to move up and down the stack of
threads, merge changes up the stack to descendant threads, create
diffs between threads, etc. Occasionally, you may need or want to
export your loom threads into separate branches, either for review
or commit. Higher threads incorporate all the changes in the lower
threads, automatically.</p>

<p>For bonus points, let’s say someone else fixes the socket module in
exactly the same way you just did. Perhaps this person even grabbed your
fix-socket thread and applied just that to the trunk. You’d like to
be able to merge their changes into your loom and delete your

<p>Several other way to approach this scenario with Mercurial. Alexander Solovyov
presented a few <a class="reference external" href="http://selenic.com/pipermail/mercurial/2009-January/023710.html">alternative approaches</a> on Mercurial’s mailing list.</p>

<span class="c1"># And push both patches to the public repository.</span>
<span class="n">git</span> <span class="n">push</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Bonus points: suppose you took your time, and someone else fixes
socket in the same way you just did, and landed that in the trunk.  In
that case, your push will fail because your branch is not up-to-date.
If the fix was a one-liner, there’s a very good chance that it’s
<em>exactly</em> the same, character for character.  git would notice that,
and you are done; git will silently merge them.</p>
<p>Suppose we’re not so lucky:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># Update your branch.</span>
<span class="n">git</span> <span class="n">pull</span> <span class="n">git</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="o">//</span><span class="n">code</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">python</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">org</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">public</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">trunk</span> <span class="n">master</span>

<span class="c1"># git has fetched all the necessary data, but reports that the</span>
<span class="c1"># merge failed.  We discover the nearly-duplicated patch.</span>
<span class="c1"># Neither our version of the master branch nor the workspace has</span>
<span class="c1"># been touched.  Revert our socket patch and pull again:</span>
<span class="n">git</span> <span class="n">revert</span> <span class="n">HEAD</span><span class="o">^</span>
<span class="n">git</span> <span class="n">pull</span> <span class="n">git</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="o">//</span><span class="n">code</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">python</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">org</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">public</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">trunk</span> <span class="n">master</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Like Bazaar and Mercurial, git has extensions to manage stacks of
patches.  You can use the original Quilt by Andrew Morton, or there is
StGit (“stacked git”) which integrates patch-tracking for large sets
of patches into the VCS in a way similar to Mercurial Queues or Bazaar
looms.</p>

<p>How does <a class="pep reference internal" href="../pep-0101/" title="PEP 101 – Doing Python Releases 101">PEP 101</a> change when using a DVCS?</p>
<section id="id23">

<p>It will change, but not substantially so. When doing the
maintenance branch, we’ll just push to the new location instead of
doing an svn cp. Tags are totally different, since in svn they are
directory copies, but in bzr (and I’m guessing hg), they are just
symbolic names for revisions on a particular branch. The release.py
script will have to change to use bzr commands instead. It’s
possible that because DVCS (in particular, bzr) does cherry picking
and merging well enough that we’ll be able to create the maint
branches sooner. It would be a useful exercise to try to do a
release off the bzr/hg mirrors.</p>

<p>Clearly, details specific to Subversion in <a class="pep reference internal" href="../pep-0101/" title="PEP 101 – Doing Python Releases 101">PEP 101</a> and in the
release script will need to be updated. In particular, release
tagging and maintenance branches creation process will have to be
modified to use Mercurial’s features; this will simplify and
streamline certain aspects of the release process. For example,
tagging and re-tagging a release will become a trivial operation
since a tag, in Mercurial, is simply a symbolic name for a given
revision.</p>

<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id25" role="doc-backlink">git</a></h4>
<p>It will change, but not substantially so. When doing the
maintenance branch, we’ll just git push to the new location instead
of doing an svn cp. Tags are totally different, since in svn they
are directory copies, but in git they are just symbolic names for
revisions, as are branches. (The difference between a tag and a
branch is that tags refer to a particular commit, and will never
change unless you use git tag -f to force them to move. The
checked-out branch, on the other hand, is automatically updated by
git commit.) The release.py script will have to change to use git
commands instead. With git I would create a (local) maintenance
branch as soon as the release engineer is chosen. Then I’d “git
pull” until I didn’t like a patch, when it would be “git pull; git
revert ugly-patch”, until it started to look like the sensible thing
is to fork off, and start doing “git cherry-pick” on the good
patches.</p>

<p>git has a cvsserver mode, ie, you can check out a tree from git
using CVS. You can even commit to the tree, but features like
merging are absent, and branches are handled as CVS modules, which
is likely to shock a veteran CVS user.</p>

<p>As I (Brett Cannon) am left with the task of making the final
decision of which/any DVCS to go with and not my co-authors, I felt
it only fair to write down what tests I ran and my impressions as I
evaluate the various tools so as to be as transparent as possible.</p>
<section id="barrier-to-entry">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#barrier-to-entry" role="doc-backlink">Barrier to Entry</a></h3>
<p>The amount of time and effort it takes to get a checkout of Python’s
repository is critical. If the difficulty or time is too great then a
person wishing to contribute to Python may very well give up. That
cannot be allowed to happen.</p>
<p>I measured the checking out of the 2.x trunk as if I was a non-core
developer. Timings were done using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">time</span></code> command in zsh and
space was calculated with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">du</span> <span class="pre">-c</span> <span class="pre">-h</span></code>.</p>
<table class="docutils align-default">
<thead>
<tr class="row-odd"><th class="head">DVCS</th>
<th class="head">San Francisco</th>
<th class="head">Vancouver</th>
<th class="head">Space</th>

<p>When comparing these numbers to svn, it is important to realize that
it is not a 1:1 comparison. Svn does not pull down the entire revision
history like all of the DVCSs do. That means svn can perform an
initial checkout much faster than the DVCS purely based on the fact
that it has less information to download for the network.</p>

<p>To see how the tools did for performing a command that required
querying the history, the log for the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">README</span></code> file was timed.</p>

<p>One thing of note during this test was that git took longer than the
other three tools to figure out how to get the log without it using a
pager. While the pager use is a nice touch in general, not having it
automatically turn on took some time (turns out the main <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span></code>
command has a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--no-pager</span></code> flag to disable use of the pager).</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#figuring-out-what-command-to-use-from-built-in-help" role="doc-backlink">Figuring out what command to use from built-in help</a></h3>
<p>I ended up trying to find out what the command was to see what URL the
repository was cloned from. To do this I used nothing more than the
help provided by the tool itself or its man pages.</p>
<p>Bzr was the easiest: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bzr</span> <span class="pre">info</span></code>. Running <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bzr</span> <span class="pre">help</span></code> didn’t show
what I wanted, but mentioned <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bzr</span> <span class="pre">help</span> <span class="pre">commands</span></code>. That list had the
command with a description that made sense.</p>
<p>Git was the second easiest. The command <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">help</span></code> didn’t show much
and did not have a way of listing all commands. That is when I viewed
the man page. Reading through the various commands I discovered <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span>
<span class="pre">remote</span></code>. The command itself spit out nothing more than <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">origin</span></code>.
Trying <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">remote</span> <span class="pre">origin</span></code> said it was an error and printed out the
command usage. That is when I noticed <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">remote</span> <span class="pre">show</span></code>. Running
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">remote</span> <span class="pre">show</span> <span class="pre">origin</span></code> gave me the information I wanted.</p>
<p>For hg, I never found the information I wanted on my own. It turns out
I wanted <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">hg</span> <span class="pre">paths</span></code>, but that was not obvious from the description
of “show definition of symbolic path names” as printed by <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">hg</span> <span class="pre">help</span></code>
(it should be noted that reporting this in the PEP did lead to the
Mercurial developers to clarify the wording to make the use of the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">hg</span> <span class="pre">paths</span></code> command clearer).</p>

<p>Git lacks a value for the <em>700 commits</em> scenario as it does

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#decision" role="doc-backlink">Decision</a></h2>
<p>At PyCon 2009 the decision was made to go with Mercurial.</p>
<section id="why-mercurial-over-subversion">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#why-mercurial-over-subversion" role="doc-backlink">Why Mercurial over Subversion</a></h3>
<p>While svn has served the development team well, it needs to be
admitted that svn does not serve the needs of non-committers as well
as a DVCS does. Because svn only provides its features such as version
control, branching, etc. to people with commit privileges on the
repository it can be a hindrance for people who lack commit
privileges. But DVCSs have no such limitation as anyone can create a
local branch of Python and perform their own local commits without the
burden that comes with cloning the entire svn repository. Allowing
anyone to have the same workflow as the core developers was the key
reason to switch from svn to hg.</p>
<p>Orthogonal to the benefits of allowing anyone to easily commit locally
to their own branches is offline, fast operations. Because hg stores
all data locally there is no need to send requests to a server
remotely and instead work off of the local disk. This improves
response times tremendously. It also allows for offline usage for when
one lacks an Internet connection. But this benefit is minor and
considered simply a side-effect benefit instead of a driving factor
for switching off of Subversion.</p>
</section>
<section id="why-mercurial-over-other-dvcss">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#why-mercurial-over-other-dvcss" role="doc-backlink">Why Mercurial over other DVCSs</a></h3>
<p>Git was not chosen for three key reasons (see the <a class="reference external" href="http://pycon.blip.tv/file/1947231/">PyCon 2009
lightning talk</a> where Brett
Cannon lists these exact reasons; talk started at 3:45). First, git’s
Windows support is the weakest out of the three DVCSs being considered
which is unacceptable as Python needs to support development on any
platform it runs on. Since Python runs on Windows and some people do
develop on the platform it needs solid support. And while git’s
support is improving, as of this moment it is the weakest by a large
enough margin to warrant considering it a problem.</p>
<p>Second, and just as important as the first issue, is that the Python
core developers liked git the least out of the three DVCS options by a
wide margin. If you look at the following table you will see the
results of a survey taken of the core developers and how by a large
margin git is the least favorite version control system.</p>
<table class="docutils align-default">
<thead>
<tr class="row-odd"><th class="head">DVCS</th>
<th class="head">++</th>
<th class="head">equal</th>
<th class="head">–</th>
<th class="head">Uninformed</th>

<tr class="row-even"><td>git</td>
<td>5</td>

<tr class="row-odd"><td>bzr</td>

<td>3</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>12</td>

<tr class="row-even"><td>hg</td>
<td>15</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>10</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Lastly, all things being equal (which they are not
as shown by the previous two issues), it is preferable to
use and support a tool written in Python and not one written in C and
shell. We are pragmatic enough to not choose a tool simply because it
is written in Python, but we do see the usefulness in promoting tools
that do use it when it is reasonable to do so as it is in this case.</p>
<p>As for why Mercurial was chosen over Bazaar, it came down to
popularity.  As the core developer survey shows, hg was preferred over
bzr. But the community also appears to prefer hg as was shown at PyCon
after git’s removal from consideration was announced. Many people came
up to Brett and said in various ways that they wanted hg to be chosen.
While no one said they did not want bzr chosen, no one said they did
either.</p>
<p>Based on all of this information, Guido and Brett decided Mercurial
was to be the next version control system for Python.</p>
