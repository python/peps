Abstract
========

This PEP proposes adding a new built-in function called ``debug()`` which
enters a Python debugger at the point of the call.  Additionally, two new
names are added to the ``sys`` module to make the debugger pluggable.


Rationale
=========

Python has long had a great debugger in its standard library called ``pdb``.
Setting a break point is commonly written like this::

    foo()
    import pdb; pdb.set_trace()
    bar()

Thus after executing ``foo()`` and before executing ``bar()``, Python will
enter the debugger.  However this idiom has several disadvantages.

* It's a lot to type (27 characters).

* It's easy to typo.  The PEP author often mistypes this line, e.g. omitting
  the semicolon, or typing a dot instead of an underscore.

* It ties debugging directly to the choice of pdb.  There might be other
  debugging options, say if you're using an IDE or some other development
  environment.

* Python linters (e.g. flake8 [1]_) complain about this line because it
  contains two statements.  Breaking the idiom up into two lines further
  complicates the use of the debugger,

These problems can be solved by modeling a solution based on prior art in
other languages, and utilizing a convention that already exists in Python.


Proposal
========

The JavaScript language provides a ``debugger`` statement [2]_ which enters
the debugger at the point where the statement appears.

This PEP proposes a new built-in function called ``debug()`` which enters a
Python debugger at the call site.  Thus the example above would be written
like so::

    foo()
    debug()
    bar()

Built-in ``debug()`` takes no arguments.

Further, this PEP proposes two new name bindings for the ``sys`` module,
called ``debughook()`` and ``__debughook__``.  By default, ``sys.debughook()``
implements the actual importing and entry into ``pdb.set_trace()``, and it can
be set to a different function to change the debugger that ``debug()`` enters.
``sys.__debughook__`` then stashes the default value of ``sys.debughook()`` to
make it easy to reset.  This exactly models the existing ``sys.displayhook()``
/ ``sys.__displayhook__`` and ``sys.excepthook()`` / ``sys.__excepthook__``
hooks [3]_.

``sys.displayhook()`` would be called with no arguments.  It returns whatever
is returned from the underlying debugger entry point.  ``debug()`` returns
whatever ``sys.displayhook()`` returns.


Open issues
===========

We want to get confirmation from at least one alternative debugger
implementation (e.g. PyCharm) that the hooks provided in this PEP will be
useful to them.

Related, there has been an idea to add a bytecode that calls
``sys.debughook()``.  Whether built-in ``debug()`` emits this bytecode (or
gets peephole optimized to the bytecode) is an open issue.  The bytecode is
useful for debuggers that actively modify bytecode streams to trampoline into
their own debugger.  Having a "debug" bytecode might allow them to avoid
bytecode modification in order to invoke this trampoline.

Does it make sense to define the built-in function's signature as
``debug(*args, **kws)`` which would just be passed along to the
``sys.debughook()``?  One argument for doing this is that it would allow users
to pass useful arguments to their actual debugger.  This isn't useful for
``pdb`` but might be useful for alternatives.


Implementation
==============

A pull request exists with the proposed implementation [4]_.


Rejected alternatives
=====================

A new keyword
-------------

Originally, the author considered a new keyword, or an extension to an
existing keyword such as ``break here``.  This is rejected on several fronts.

* A brand new keyword would require a ``__future__`` to enable it since almost
  any new keyword could conflict with existing code.  This negates the ease
  with which you can enter the debugger.

* An extended keyword such as ``break here``, while more readable and not
  requiring a ``__future__`` would tie the keyword extension to this new
  feature, preventing more useful extensions such as those proposed in
  PEP 548.

* A new keyword would require a modified grammar and likely a new bytecode.
  Each of these makes the implementation more complex.  A new built-in breaks
  no existing code (since any existing module global would just shadow the
  built-in) and is quite easy to implement.

sys.debug()
-----------

Why not ``sys.debug()``?  Requiring an import to invoke the debugger is
explicitly rejected because ``sys`` is not imported in every module.  That
just requires more typing and would lead to::

    import sys; sys.debug()

which inherits several of the problems this PEP aims to solve.
