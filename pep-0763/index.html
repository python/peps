<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#pep-withdrawal" role="doc-backlink">PEP Withdrawal</a></h2>
<p>This PEP has been withdrawn as of 22-Sep-2025.</p>
<p>During discussion of the PEP, it became clear that a PEP is not necessarily
the appropriate venue for changes to PyPI’s deletion policy, as
PyPI’s usage policies are not presently (or necessarily should) be part of the
PEP process.</p>
</section>
<section id="abstract">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#abstract" role="doc-backlink">Abstract</a></h2>
<p>We propose limiting when users can delete files, releases, and projects
from PyPI. A project, release, or file may only be deleted within 72 hours
of when it is uploaded to the index. From this point, users may only use
the “yank” mechanism specified by <a class="pep reference internal" href="../pep-0592/" title="PEP 592 – Adding “Yank” Support to the Simple API">PEP 592</a>.</p>
<p>An exception to this restriction is made for releases and files that are
marked with <a class="reference external" href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/version-specifiers/#version-specifiers" title="(in Python Packaging User Guide)"><span class="xref std std-ref">pre-release specifiers</span></a>,
which will remain deletable at any time.
The PyPI administrators will retain the ability to delete files, releases,
and projects at any time, for example for moderation or security purposes.</p>
</section>
<section id="rationale-and-motivation">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#rationale-and-motivation" role="doc-backlink">Rationale and Motivation</a></h2>
<p>As observed in <a class="pep reference internal" href="../pep-0592/" title="PEP 592 – Adding “Yank” Support to the Simple API">PEP 592</a>, user-level deletion of projects on PyPI
enables a catch-22 situation of dependency breakage:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Whenever a project detects that a particular release on PyPI might be
broken, they oftentimes will want to prevent further users from
inadvertently using that version. However, the obvious solution of
deleting the existing file from a repository will break users who have
pinned to a specific version of the project.<p>This leaves projects in a catch-22 situation where new projects may be pulling
down this known broken version, but if they do anything to prevent that they’ll
break projects that are already using it.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>On a technical level, the problem of deletion is mitigated by
“yanking,” also specified in <a class="pep reference internal" href="../pep-0592/" title="PEP 592 – Adding “Yank” Support to the Simple API">PEP 592</a>. However, deletions continue to be
allowed on PyPI, and have caused multiple notable disruptions to the Python
ecosystem over the interceding years:</p>
<ul>
<li>July 2022: <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/atomicwrites/">atomicwrites</a>
was <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/untitaker/python-atomicwrites/issues/61">deleted by its maintainer</a>
in an attempt to remove the project’s “critical” designation, without the
maintainer realizing that project deletion would also delete all previously
uploaded releases.<p>The project was subsequently restored with the maintainer’s consent,
but at the cost of manual administrator action and extensive downstream
breakage to projects like <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10114">pytest</a>.
As of October 2024, atomicwrites is archived but still has
around <a class="reference external" href="https://pypistats.org/packages/atomicwrites">4.5 million monthly downloads from PyPI</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>April 2023: <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/codecov/">codecov</a> was deleted by
its maintainers after a long deprecation period. This caused extensive
breakage for many of Codecov’s CI/CD users, who were unaware of the
deprecation period due to limited observability of deprecation warnings
within CI/CD logs.<p>The project was
<a class="reference external" href="https://about.codecov.io/blog/message-regarding-the-pypi-package/">subsequently re-created</a>
by its maintainers, with a new release published to compensate for the deleted releases
(which were not restored), meaning that any pinned installations remained
broken. As of October 2024, this single release remains the only release on
PyPI and has around
<a class="reference external" href="https://pypistats.org/packages/codecov">1.5 million monthly downloads</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>June 2023: <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/python-sonarqube-api/">python-sonarqube-api</a>
deleted all released releases prior to 2.0.2.<p>The project’s maintainer subsequently
<a class="reference external" href="https://discuss.python.org/t/stop-allowing-deleting-things-from-pypi/17227/114">deleted conversations</a>
and force-pushed over the tag history for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">python-sonarqube-api</span></code>’s source
repository, impeding efforts by users to compare changes between
releases.</p>
</li>
<li>June 2024: <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/PySimpleGUI/">PySimpleGUI</a> changed
licenses and deleted
<a class="reference external" href="https://discuss.python.org/t/48790/27">nearly all previous releases</a>.
This resulted in widespread disruption for users, who (prior to the
relicensing) were downloading PySimpleGUI approximately 25,000 times a day.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to their disruptive effect on downstreams, deletions
also have detrimental effects on PyPI’s sustainability as well as the overall
security of the ecosystem:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Deletions increase support workload for PyPI’s administrators and
moderators, as users mistakenly file support requests believing that PyPI
is broken, or that the administrators themselves have removed the
project.</li>
<li>Deletions impair external (meaning end-user) incident response and analysis,
making it difficult to distinguish “good faith” maintainer behavior from
a malicious actor attempting the cover their tracks.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Python ecosystem is continuing to grow,
meaning that future deletions of projects can be reasonably assumed to
be <em>just, as if not more,</em> disruptive than the deletions sampled above.</p>
<p>Given all of the above, this PEP concludes that deletions now present a greater
risk and detriment to the Python ecosystem than a benefit.</p>
<p>In addition to these technical arguments, there is also precedent
from other packaging ecosystems for limiting the ability of users to delete
projects and their constituent releases. This precedent is documented in
<a class="reference internal" href="#pep763-appendix-a"><span class="std std-ref">Appendix A</span></a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="specification">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#specification" role="doc-backlink">Specification</a></h2>
<p>There are three different types of deletable objects:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><strong>Files</strong>, which are individual project distributions (such as source
distributions or wheels).<p>Example: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">requests-2.32.3-py3-none-any.whl</span></code>.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Releases</strong>, which contain one or more files that share the same version
number.<p>Example: <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/requests/2.32.3/">requests v2.32.3</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Projects</strong>, which contain one or more releases.<p>Example: <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/requests">requests</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<section id="deletion-eligibility-rules">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#deletion-eligibility-rules" role="doc-backlink">Deletion eligibility rules</a></h3>
<p>This PEP proposes the following <em>deletion eligibility rules</em>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A <strong>file</strong> is deletable if and only if it was uploaded to
PyPI less than 72 hours from the current time, <strong>or</strong> if it
has a <a class="reference external" href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/version-specifiers/#version-specifiers" title="(in Python Packaging User Guide)"><span class="xref std std-ref">pre-release specifier</span></a>.</li>
<li>A <strong>release</strong> is deletable if and only if all of its
contained files are deletable.</li>
<li>A <strong>project</strong> is deletable if and only if all of its releases are deletable.</li>
</ul>
<p>These rules allow new projects to be
deleted entirely, and allow old projects to delete new files or releases,
but do not allow old projects to delete old files or releases.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="implementation">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#implementation" role="doc-backlink">Implementation</a></h2>
<p>This PEP’s implementation primarily concerns aspects of PyPI that are not
standardized or subject to standardization, such as the web interface and
signed-in user operations. As a result, this section describes its
implementation in behavioral terms.</p>
<section id="changes">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#changes" role="doc-backlink">Changes</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Per the eligibility rules above, PyPI will reject web interface requests
(using an appropriate HTTP response code of its choosing) for
file, release, or project deletion if the respective object is not
eligible for deletion.</li>
<li>PyPI will amend its web interface to indicate a file/release/project’s
deletion ineligibility, e.g. by styling the relevant UI elements as “inactive”
and making relevant bottoms/forms unclickable.</li>
</ul>
</section>
</section>
<section id="security-implications">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#security-implications" role="doc-backlink">Security Implications</a></h2>
<p>This PEP does not identify negative security implications associated with the
proposed approach.</p>
<p>This PEP identifies one minor positive security implication: by restricting
user-controlled deletions, this PEP makes it more difficult for a malicious
actor to cover their tracks by deleting malware from the index. This is
particularly useful for external (i.e. non-PyPI administrator) triage and
incident response, where the defending party needs easy access to malware
samples to develop indicators of compromise.</p>
</section>
<section id="how-to-teach-this">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#how-to-teach-this" role="doc-backlink">How To Teach This</a></h2>
<p>This PEP suggests at least two pieces of public-facing material to help
the larger Python packaging community (and its downstream consumers)
understand its changes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>An announcement post on the <a class="reference external" href="https://blog.pypi.org">PyPI blog</a> explaining
the nature of the PEP, its motivations, and its behavioral implications for
PyPI.</li>
<li>An announcement banner on PyPI itself, linking to the above.</li>
<li>Updates to the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.pypi.org/">PyPI user documentation</a> explaining
the difference between deletion and yanking and the limited conditions under
which the former can still be initiated by package owners.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="rejected-ideas">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#rejected-ideas" role="doc-backlink">Rejected Ideas</a></h2>
<section id="conditioning-deletion-on-dependency-relationships">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#conditioning-deletion-on-dependency-relationships" role="doc-backlink">Conditioning deletion on dependency relationships</a></h3>
<p>An alternative to time-based deletion windows is deletion eligibility based on
downstream dependents. For example, a release could be considered deletable
if and only if it has fewer than <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">N</span></code> downstream dependents on PyPI,
where <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">N</span></code> could be as low as 1.</p>
<p>This idea is appealing since it directly links deletion eligibility to
disruptiveness. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm</a> uses it and
conditions project removal on the absence of any downstream dependencies
known to the index.</p>
<p>Despite its appeal, this PEP identifies several disadvantages and technical
limitations that make dependency-conditioned deletion not appropriate
for PyPI:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><em>PyPI is not aware of dependency relationships.</em> In Python packaging,
both project builds <em>and</em> metadata generation are frequently dynamic
operations, involving arbitrary project-specified code. This is typified
by source distributions containing <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">setup.py</span></code> scripts, where the execution
of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">setup.py</span></code> is responsible for computing the set of dependencies
encoded in the project’s metadata.<p>This is in marked contrast to ecosystems like npm and Rust’s
<a class="reference external" href="https://crates.io/">crates</a>, where project <em>builds</em> can be dynamic but
the project’s metadata itself is static.</p>
<p>As a result of this, <a class="reference external" href="https://dustingram.com/articles/2018/03/05/why-pypi-doesnt-know-dependencies/">PyPI doesn’t know your project’s dependencies</a>,
and is architecturally incapable of knowing them without either running
arbitrary code (a significant security risk) or performing a long-tail
deprecation of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">setup.py</span></code>-based builds in favor of <a class="pep reference internal" href="../pep-0517/" title="PEP 517 – A build-system independent format for source trees">PEP 517</a> and
<a class="pep reference internal" href="../pep-0621/" title="PEP 621 – Storing project metadata in pyproject.toml">PEP 621</a>-style static metadata.</p>
</li>
<li><em>Results in an unintuitive permissions model.</em> Dependency-conditioned
deletion results in a “reversed” power relationship, where anybody
who introduces a dependency on a project can prevent that project from
being deleted.<p>This is reasonable on face value, but can be abused to produce unexpected
and undesirable (in the context of enabling some deletions) outcomes.
A notable example of this is npm’s
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/everything">everything package</a>, which
depends on every public package on npm (as of 30 Dec 2023) and thereby
prevents their deletion.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="conditioning-deletion-on-download-count">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#conditioning-deletion-on-download-count" role="doc-backlink">Conditioning deletion on download count</a></h3>
<p>Another alternative to time-based deletion windows is to delete based on the
number of downloads. For example, a release could be considered deletable if
and only if it has fewer than <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">N</span></code> downloads during the last period.</p>
<p>While presenting advantages by tying a project deletion possibility to its
usage, this PEP identifies several limitations to this approach:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><em>Ecosystem diversity.</em> The Python ecosystem includes projects with widely
varying usage patterns. A fixed download threshold would not adequately account
for niche but critical projects with naturally low download counts.</li>
<li><em>Time sensitivity.</em> Download counts do not necessarily reflect a project’s
current status or importance. A previously popular project might have low
recent downloads but still be crucial for maintaining older systems.</li>
<li><em>Technical complexity.</em> Accessing the download count of a project within
PyPI is not straightforward, and there is limited possibility to gather a
project’s download statistics from mirrors or other distributions systems.</li>
</ol>

<span id="pep763-appendix-a"></span><h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#appendix-a-precedent-in-other-ecosystems" role="doc-backlink">Appendix A: Precedent in other ecosystems</a></h2>
<p>The following is a table of support for deletion in different packaging
ecosystems. An ecosystem is considered to <strong>not</strong> support deletion
if it restrict’s a user’s ability to perform deletions in a manner similar
to this PEP.</p>

<p>The following trends are present:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A strong majority of indices <strong>do not</strong> support deletion (9 vs. 4)</li>
<li>A strong majority of indices <strong>do</strong> support yanking (9 vs. 4)</li>
<li>An overwhelming majority of indices support one or the other or neither,
but <strong>not</strong> both (11 vs. 2)<ul>
<li>PyPI and LuaRocks are notable outliers in supporting <strong>both</strong> deletion and
yanking.</li>
</ul>
