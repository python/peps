What is a PEP?

    PEP stands for Python Enhancement Proposal.  A PEP is a design
    document providing information to the Python community, or
    describing a new feature for Python.  The PEP should provide a
    concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for
    the feature.

    We intend PEPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing new
    features, for collecting community input on an issue, and for
    documenting the design decisions that have gone into Python.  The
    PEP author is responsible for building consensus within the
    community and documenting dissenting opinions.

    Because the PEPs are maintained as plain text files under CVS
    control, their revision history is the historical record of the
    feature proposal[1].
    

Kinds of PEPs

    There are two kinds of PEPs.  A standards track PEP describes a
    new feature or implementation for Python.  An informational PEP
    describes a Python design issue, or provides general guidelines or
    information to the Python community, but does not propose a new
    feature.


PEP Work Flow

    The PEP editor, Barry Warsaw <barry@zope.com>, assigns numbers
    for each PEP and changes its status.

    The PEP process begins with a new idea for Python.  Each PEP must
    have a champion -- someone who writes the PEP using the style and
    format described below, shepherds the discussions in the
    appropriate forums, and attempts to build community consensus
    around the idea.  The PEP champion (a.k.a. Author) should first
    attempt to ascertain whether the idea is PEP-able.  Small
    enhancements or patches often don't need a PEP and can be injected
    into the Python development work flow with a patch submission to
    the SourceForge patch manager[2] or feature request tracker[3].

    The PEP champion then emails the PEP editor with a proposed title
    and a rough, but fleshed out, draft of the PEP.  This draft must
    be written in PEP style as described below.

    If the PEP editor approves, he will assign the PEP a number, label
    it as standards track or informational, give it status 'draft',
    and create and check-in the initial draft of the PEP.  The PEP
    editor will not unreasonably deny a PEP.  Reasons for denying PEP
    status include duplication of effort, being technically unsound,
    or not in keeping with the Python philosophy.  The BDFL
    (Benevolent Dictator for Life, Guido van Rossum
    <guido@python.org>) can be consulted during the approval phase,
    and is the final arbitrator of the draft's PEP-ability.

    The author of the PEP is then responsible for posting the PEP to
    the community forums, and marshaling community support for it.  As
    updates are necessary, the PEP author can check in new versions if
    they have CVS commit permissions, or can email new PEP versions to
    the PEP editor for committing.

    Standards track PEPs consists of two parts, a design document and
    a reference implementation.  The PEP should be reviewed and
    accepted before a reference implementation is begun, unless a
    reference implementation will aid people in studying the PEP.
    Standards Track PEPs must include an implementation - in the form
    of code, patch, or URL to same - before it can be considered
    Final.

    PEP authors are responsible for collecting community feedback on a
    PEP before submitting it for review.  A PEP that has not been
    discussed on python-list@python.org and/or python-dev@python.org
    will not be accepted.  However, wherever possible, long open-ended
    discussions on public mailing lists should be avoided.  A better
    strategy is to encourage public feedback directly to the PEP
    author, who collects and integrates the comments back into the
    PEP.

    Once the authors have completed a PEP, they must inform the PEP
    editor that it is ready for review.  PEPs are reviewed by the BDFL
    and his chosen consultants, who may accept or reject a PEP or send
    it back to the author(s) for revision.

    Once a PEP has been accepted, the reference implementation must be
    completed.  When the reference implementation is complete and
    accepted by the BDFL, the status will be changed to `Final.'

    A PEP can also be assigned status `Deferred.'  The PEP author or
    editor can assign the PEP this status when no progress is being
    made on the PEP.  Once a PEP is deferred, the PEP editor can
    re-assign it to draft status.

    A PEP can also be `Rejected'.  Perhaps after all is said and done
    it was not a good idea.  It is still important to have a record of
    this fact.

    PEPs can also be replaced by a different PEP, rendering the
    original obsolete.  This is intended for Informational PEPs, where
    version 2 of an API can replace version 1.

    PEP work flow is as follows:

        Draft -> Accepted -> Final -> Replaced
          ^
          +----> Rejected
          v
        Deferred

    Some informational PEPs may also have a status of `Active' if they
    are never meant to be completed.  E.g. PEP 1.


What belongs in a successful PEP?

    Each PEP should have the following parts:

    1. Preamble -- RFC822 style headers containing meta-data about the
       PEP, including the PEP number, a short descriptive title
       (limited to a maximum of 44 characters), the names contact info
       for each author, etc.

    2. Abstract -- a short (~200 word) description of the technical
       issue being addressed.

    3. Copyright/public domain -- Each PEP must either be explicitly
       labelled in the public domain or the Open Publication
       License[4].

    4. Specification -- The technical specification should describe
       the syntax and semantics of any new language feature.  The
       specification should be detailed enough to allow competing,
       interoperable implementations for any of the current Python
       platforms (CPython, JPython, Python .NET).

    5. Rationale -- The rationale fleshes out the specification by
       describing what motivated the design and why particular design
       decisions were made.  It should describe alternate designs that
       were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is
       supported in other languages.

       The rationale should provide evidence of consensus within the
       community and discuss important objections or concerns raised
       during discussion.

    6. Reference Implementation -- The reference implementation must
       be completed before any PEP is given status 'Final,' but it
       need not be completed before the PEP is accepted.  It is better
       to finish the specification and rationale first and reach
       consensus on it before writing code.

       The final implementation must include test code and
       documentation appropriate for either the Python language
       reference or the standard library reference.


PEP Style

    PEPs are written in plain ASCII text, and should adhere to a
    rigid style.  There is a Python script that parses this style and
    converts the plain text PEP to HTML for viewing on the web[5].

    Each PEP must begin with an RFC822 style header preamble.  The
    headers must appear in the following order.  Headers marked with
    `*' are optional and are described below.  All other headers are
    required.

        PEP: <pep number>
        Title: <pep title>
        Version: <cvs version string>
      * Last-Modified: <cvs date string>
        Author: <list of authors' email and real name>
      * Discussions-To: <email address>
        Status: <Draft | Active | Accepted | Deferred | Final | Replaced>
        Type: <Informational | Standards Track>
      * Requires: <pep numbers>
        Created: <date created on, in dd-mmm-yyyy format>
      * Python-Version: <version number>
        Post-History: <dates of postings to python-list and python-dev>
      * Replaces: <pep number>
      * Replaced-By: <pep number>

    Standards track PEPs must have a Python-Version: header which
    indicates the version of Python that the feature will be released
    with.  Informational PEPs do not need a Python-Version: header.

    While a PEP is in private discussions (usually during the initial
    Draft phase), a Discussions-To: header will indicate the mailing
    list or URL where the PEP is being discussed.  No Discussions-To:
    header is necessary if the PEP is being discussed privately with
    the author, or on the python-list or python-dev email mailing
    lists.

    PEPs may have a Requires: header, indicating the PEP numbers that
    this PEP depends on.

    PEPs may also have a Replaced-By: header indicating that a PEP has
    been rendered obsolete by a later document; the value is the
    number of the PEP that replaces the current document.  The newer
    PEP must have a Replaces: header containing the number of the PEP
    that it rendered obsolete.

    PEP headings must begin in column zero and the initial letter of
    each word must be capitalized as in book titles.  Acronyms should
    be in all capitals.  The body of each section must be indented 4
    spaces.  Code samples inside body sections should be indented a
    further 4 spaces, and other indentation can be used as required to
    make the text readable.  You must use two blank lines between the
    last line of a section's body and the next section heading.

    Tab characters must never appear in the document at all.  A PEP
    should include the Emacs stanza included by example in this PEP.

    A PEP must contain a Copyright section, and it is strongly
    recommended to put the PEP in the public domain.

    When referencing an external web page in the body of a PEP, you
    should include the title of the page in the text, with a
    footnote reference to the URL.  Do not include the URL in the body
    text of the PEP.  E.g.

        Refer to the Python Language web site [1] for more details.
        ...
        [1] http://www.python.org

    When referring to another PEP, include the PEP number in the body
    text, such as "PEP 1".  The title may optionally appear.  Add a
    footnote reference that includes the PEP's title and author.  It
    may optionally include the explicit URL on a separate line, but
    only in the References section.  Note that the pep2html.py script
    will calculate URLs automatically, e.g.:

            ...
            Refer to PEP 1 [7] for more information about PEP style
            ...

    If you decide to provide an explicit URL for a PEP, please use
    this as the URL template:

        http://www.python.org/peps/pep-xxxx.html

    PEP numbers in URLs must be padded with zeros from the left, so as
    to be exactly 4 characters wide, however PEP numbers in text are
    never padded.


Reporting PEP Bugs, or Submitting PEP Updates

    Please use the SourceForge bug manager[6] if you want to report
    problems with PEPs, or better yet, the SourceForge patch
    manager[2] for submitting patches to PEPs.
