Abstract
========

Using the tag system outlined in :pep:`425` (primarily used for wheel
file names), each release of Python specifies compatibility tags
(e.g. ``cp39``, ``py39`` for CPython 3.9). For CPython 3.10, this PEP
proposes using ``3_10`` as the version portion of the tags
(instead of ``310``).


Motivation
==========

Up to this point, the version portion of compatibility tags used in
e.g. wheel file names has been a straight concatenation of the major
and minor versions of Python, both for the CPython interpreter tag and
the generic, interpreter-agnostic interpreter tag (e.g. ``cp39`` and
``py39``, respectively). This also applies to the ABI tag
(e.g. ``cp39``). Thanks to both the major and minor versions being
single digits, it has been unambiguous what which digit in e.g. ``39``
represented.

But starting with Python 3.10, ambiguity comes up as ``310`` does not
clearly delineate whether the Python version is ``3.10``, ``31.0``, or
``310`` as the major-only version of Python. Thus using ``3_10`` to
separate major/minor portions as allowed by :pep:`425` disambiguates
the Python version being supported.


Rationale
=========

Using ``3_10`` instead of another proposed separator is a restriction
of :pep:`425`, thus the only options are ``3_10`` or ``310``.


Specification
=============

The ``SOABI`` configure variable and
``sysconfig.get_config_var('py_version_nodot')`` will be updated to
use ``3_10`` appropriately.


Backwards Compatibility
=======================

Tools relying on the 'packaging' project [2]_ already expect a
version specification of ``3_10`` for Python 3.10. Keeping the version
specifier as ``310`` would require backing that change out and
updating dependent projects (e.g. pip).

Switching to ``3_10`` will impact any tools that implicitly rely on
the convention that the minor version is a single digit. However,
these are broken regardless of any change here.

For tools assuming the major version is only the first digit, they
will require updating if we switch to ``3_10``.

In non-locale ASCII, ``_`` sorts after any digit, so lexicographic
sorting matching a sort by Python version of a wheel file name will be
kept.

Since PEP 515 (Python 3.6), underscores in numeric literals are ignored.
This means that ``int("3_10")`` and ``int("310")`` produce the same result,
and ordering based on conversion to an integer will be preserved.
**However**, this is still a bad way to sort tags, and the point is raised
here simply to show that this proposal does not make things worse.

Security Implications
=====================

There are no known security concerns.


How to Teach This
=================

As use of the interpreter tag is mostly machine-based and this PEP
disambiguates, there should not be any special teaching consideration
required.


Reference Implementation
========================

A pull request [1]_ already exists adding support to CPython 3.10.
Support for reading wheel files with this proposed PEP is already
implemented.


Rejected Ideas
==============

Not making the change
---------------------
It was considered to not change the tag and stay with ``310``. The
argument was it's less work and it won't break any existing
tooling. But in the end it was thought that the disambiguation is
better to have.


Open Issues
===========

How far should we take this?
----------------------------
Other places where the major and minor version are used could be
updated to use an underscore as well (e.g. ``.pyc`` files, the import
path to the zip file for the stdlib). It is not known how useful it
would be to make this pervasive.
