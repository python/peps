Abstract
========

PEP 498 proposes new syntactic support for string interpolation that is
transparent to the compiler, allow name references from the interpolation
operation full access to containing namespaces (as with any other expression),
rather than being limited to explicitly name references.

However, it only offers this capability for string formatting, making it likely
we will see code like the following::

    os.system(f"echo {user_message}")

This kind of code is superficially elegant, but poses a significant problem
if the interpolated value ``user_message`` is in fact provided by a user: it's
an opening for a form of code injection attack, where the supplied user data
has not been properly escaped before being passed to the ``os.system`` call.

To address that problem (and a number of other concerns), this PEP proposes an
alternative approach to compiler supported interpolation, using ``i`` (for
"interpolation") as the new string prefix and a substitution syntax
inspired by that used in ``string.Template`` and ES6 JavaScript, rather than
adding a 4th substitution variable syntax to Python.

Some possible examples of the proposed syntax::

    msg = str(i'My age next year is ${age+1}, my anniversary is ${anniversary:%A, %B %d, %Y}.')
    print(_(i"This is a $translated $message"))
    translated = l20n(i"{{ $user }} is running {{ appname }}")
    myquery = sql(i"SELECT $column FROM $table;")
    mycommand = sh(i"cat $filename")
    mypage = html(i"<html><body>${response.body}</body></html>")
    callable = defer(i"$x + $y")

Summary of differences from PEP 498
===================================

The key differences of this proposal relative to PEP 498:

* "i" (interpolation template) prefix rather than "f" (formatted string)
* string.Template/JavaScript inspired substitution syntax, rather than str.format/C# inspired
* interpolation templates are created at runtime as a new kind of object
* the default rendering is invoked by calling ``str()`` on a template object
  rather than automatically

Proposal
========

This PEP proposes the introduction of a new string prefix that declares the
string to be an interpolation template rather than an ordinary string::

    template = i"Substitute $names and ${expressions} at runtime"

This would be effectively interpreted as::

    _raw_template = "Substitute $names and ${expressions} at runtime"
    _parsed_fields = (
        ("Substitute ", 0, "names", "", ""),
        (" and ", 1, "expressions", "", ""),
        (" at runtime", None, None, None, None),
    )
    _field_values = (names, expressions)
    template = types.InterpolationTemplate(_raw_template,
                                           _parsed_fields,
                                           _field_values)

The ``__str__`` method on ``types.InterpolationTemplate`` would then implementat
the following ``str.format`` inspired semantics::

  >>> import datetime
  >>> name = 'Jane'
  >>> age = 50
  >>> anniversary = datetime.date(1991, 10, 12)
  >>> str(i'My name is $name, my age next year is ${age+1}, my anniversary is ${anniversary:%A, %B %d, %Y}.')
  'My name is Jane, my age next year is 51, my anniversary is Saturday, October 12, 1991.'
  >>> str(i'She said her name is ${name!r}.')
  "She said her name is 'Jane'."

The interpolation template prefix can be combined with single-quoted,
double-quoted and triple quoted strings, including raw strings. It does not
support combination with bytes literals.

This PEP does not propose to remove or deprecate any of the existing
string formatting mechanisms, as those will remain valuable when formatting
strings that are not present directly in the source code of the application.


Rationale
=========

PEP 498 makes interpolating values into strings with full access to Python's
lexical namespace semantics simpler, but it does so at the cost of creating a
situation where interpolating values into sensitive targets like SQL queries,
shell commands and HTML templates will enjoy a much cleaner syntax when handled
without regard for code injection attacks than when they are handled correctly.
It also has the effect of introducing yet another syntax for substitution
expressions into Python, when we already have 3 (``str.format``,
``bytes.__mod__`` and ``string.Template``)

This PEP proposes to handle the former issue by deferring the actual rendering
of the interpolation template to its ``__str__`` method (allow the use of
other template renderers by passing the template around as an object), and the
latter by adopting the ``string.Template`` substitution syntax defined in PEP
292.

The substitution syntax devised for PEP 292 is deliberately simple so that the
template strings can be extracted into an i18n message catalog, and passed to
translators who may not themselves be developers. For these use cases, it is
important that the interpolation syntax be as simple as possible, as the
translators are responsible for preserving the substition markers, even as
they translate the surrounding text. The PEP 292 syntax is also a common mesage
catalog syntax already supporting by many commercial software translation
support tools.

PEP 498 correctly points out that the PEP 292 syntax isn't as flexible as that
introduced for general purpose string formatting in PEP 3101, so this PEP adds
that flexibility to the ``${ref}`` construct in PEP 292, and allows translation
tools the option of rejecting usage of that more advanced syntax at runtime,
rather than categorically rejecting it at compile time. The proposed permitted
expressions, conversion specifiers, and format specifiers inside ``${ref}`` are
exactly as defined for ``{ref}`` substituion in PEP 498.

The specific proposal in this PEP is also deliberately close in both syntax
and semantics to the general purpose interpolation syntax introduced to
JavaScript in ES6, as we can reasonably expect a great many Python developers
to be regularly switching back and forth between user interface code written in
JavaScript and core application code written in Python.


Specification
=============

This PEP proposes the introduction of ``i`` as a new string prefix that
results in the creation of an instance of a new type,
``types.InterpolationTemplate``.

Interpolation template literals are Unicode strings (bytes literals are not
permitted), and string literal concatenation operates as normal, with the
entire combined literal forming the interpolation template.

The template string is parsed into literals and expressions. Expressions
appear as either identifiers prefixed with a single "$" character, or
surrounded be a leading '${' and a trailing '}. The parts of the format string
that are not expressions are separated out as string literals.

While parsing the string, any doubled ``$$`` is replaced with a single ``$``
and is considered part of the literal text, rather than as introducing an
expression.

These components are then organised into an instance of a new type with the
following semantics::

    class InterpolationTemplate:
        __slots__ = ("raw_template", "parsed_fields", "field_values")

        def __new__(cls, raw_template, parsed_fields, field_values):
            self = super().__new__()
            self.raw_template = raw_template
            self.parsed_fields = parsed_fields
            self.field_values = field_values
            return self

        def __iter__(self):
            # Support iterable unpacking
            yield self.raw_template
            yield self.parsed_fields
            yield self.field_values

        def __repr__(self):
            return str(i"<${type(self).__qualname__} ${self.raw_template!r} "
                        "at ${id(self):#x}>")

        def __str__(self):
            # See definition of the default template rendering below

The result of the interpolation template expression is an instance of this
type, rather than an already rendered string - default rendering only takes
place when the instance's ``__str__`` method is called.

The format of the parsed fields tuple is inspired by the interface of
``string.Formatter.parse``, and consists of a series of 5-tuples each
containing:

* a leading string literal (may be the empty string)
* the substitution field position (zero-based enumeration)
* the substitution expression text
* the substitution conversion specifier (as defined by str.format)
* the substitution format specifier (as defined by str.format)

This field ordering is defined such that reading the parsed field tuples from
left to right will have all the subcomponents displayed in the same order as
they appear in the original template string.

For ease of access the sequence elements will be available as attributes in
addition to being available by position:

* ``leading_text``
* ``field_position``
* ``expression``
* ``conversion``
* ``format``

The expression text is simply the text of the substitution expression, as it
appeared in the original string, but without the leading and/or surrounding
expression markers. The conversion specifier and format specifier are separated
from the substition expression by ``!`` and ``:`` as defined for ``str.format``.

If a given substition field has no leading literal section, conversion specifier
or format specifier, then the corresponding elements in the tuple are the
empty string. If the final part of the string has no trailing substitution
field, then the field position, field expression, conversion specifier and
format specifier will all be ``None``.

The substitution field values tuple is created by evaluating the interpolated
expressions in the exact runtime context where the interpolation expression
appears in the source code.

For the following example interpolation template::

    i'abc${expr1:spec1}${expr2!r:spec2}def${expr3:!s}ghi $ident $$jkl'

the parsed fields tuple would be::

    (
      ('abc', 0, 'expr1', '', 'spec1'),
      ('', 1, 'expr2', 'r', 'spec2'),
      (def', 2, 'expr3', 's', ''),
      ('ghi', 3, 'ident', '', ''),
      ('$jkl', None, None, None, None)
    )

While the field values tuple would be::

    (expr1, expr2, expr3, ident)

The parsed fields tuple can be constant folded at compile time, while the
expression values tuple will always need to be constructed at runtime.

The ``InterpolationTemplate.__str__`` implementation would have the following
semantics, with field processing being defined in terms of the ``format``
builtin and ``str.format`` conversion specifiers::

    _converter = string.Formatter().convert_field

    def __str__(self):
        raw_template, fields, values = self
        template_parts = []
        for leading_text, field_num, expr, conversion, format_spec in fields:
            template_parts.append(leading_text)
            if field_num is not None:
                value = values[field_num]
                if conversion:
                    value = _converter(value, conversion)
                field_text = format(value, format_spec)
                template_parts.append(field_str)
        return "".join(template_parts)

Writing custom interpolators
----------------------------

Writing a custom interpolator doesn't requiring any special syntax. Instead,
custom interpolators are ordinary callables that process an interpolation
template directly based on the ``raw_template``, ``parsed_fields`` and
``field_values`` attributes, rather than relying on the default rendered.


Expression evaluation
---------------------

The subexpressions that are extracted from the interpolation expression are
evaluated in the context where the interpolation expression appears. This means
the expression has full access to local, nonlocal and global variables. Any
valid Python expression can be used inside ``${}``, including function and
method calls. References without the surrounding braces are limited to looking
up single identifiers.

Because the substitution expressions are evaluated where the string appears in
the source code, there are no additional security concerns related to the
contents of the expression itself, as you could have also just written the
same expression and used runtime field parsing::

  >>> bar=10
  >>> def foo(data):
  ...   return data + 20
  ...
  >>> str(i'input=$bar, output=${foo(bar)}')
  'input=10, output=30'

Is essentially equivalent to::

  >>> 'input={}, output={}'.format(bar, foo(bar))
  'input=10, output=30'

Handling code injection attacks
-------------------------------

The proposed interpolation syntax makes it potentially attractive to write
code like the following::

    myquery = str(i"SELECT $column FROM $table;")
    mycommand = str(i"cat $filename")
    mypage = str(i"<html><body>${response.body}</body></html>")

These all represent potential vectors for code injection attacks, if any of the
variables being interpolated happen to come from an untrusted source. The
specific proposal in this PEP is designed to make it straightforward to write
use case specific interpolators that take care of quoting interpolated values
appropriately for the relevant security context::

    myquery = sql(i"SELECT $column FROM $table;")
    mycommand = sh(i"cat $filename")
    mypage = html(i"<html><body>${response.body}</body></html>")

This PEP does not cover adding such interpolators to the standard library,
but instead ensures they can be readily provided by third party libraries.

(Although it's tempting to propose adding InterpolationTemplate support at
least to ``subprocess.call``, ``subprocess.check_call`` and
``subprocess.check_output``)

Format and conversion specifiers
--------------------------------

Aside from separating them out from the substitution expression, format and
conversion specifiers are otherwise treated as opaque strings by the
interpolation template parser - assigning semantics to those (or, alternatively,
prohibiting their use) is handled at runtime by the specified interpolator.

Error handling
--------------

Either compile time or run time errors can occur when processing interpolation
expressions. Compile time errors are limited to those errors that can be
detected when parsing a template string into its component tuples. These
errors all raise SyntaxError.

Unmatched braces::

  >>> i'x=${x'
    File "<stdin>", line 1
  SyntaxError: missing '}' in interpolation expression

Invalid expressions::

  >>> i'x=${!x}'
    File "<fstring>", line 1
      !x
      ^
  SyntaxError: invalid syntax

Run time errors occur when evaluating the expressions inside a
template string before creating the interpolation template object. See PEP 498
for some examples.

Different interpolators may also impose additional runtime
constraints on acceptable interpolated expressions and other formatting
details, which will be reported as runtime exceptions.


Internationalising interpolated strings
=======================================

Since this PEP derives its interpolation syntax from the internationalisation
focused PEP 292, it's worth considering the potential implications this PEP
may have for the internationalisation use case.

Internationalisation enters the picture by writing a custom interpolator that
performs internationalisation. For example, the following implementation
would delegate interpolation calls to ``string.Template``::

    def i18n(template):
        # A real implementation would also handle normal strings
        raw_template, fields, values = template
        translated = gettext.gettext(raw_template)
        value_map = _build_interpolation_map(fields, values)
        return string.Template(translated).safe_substitute(value_map)

    def _build_interpolation_map(fields, values):
        field_values = {}
        for literal_text, field_num, expr, conversion, format_spec in fields:
            assert expr.isidentifier() and not conversion and not format_spec
            if field_num is not None:
                field_values[expr] = values[field_num]
        return field_values

And would could then be invoked as::

    # _ = i18n at top of module or injected into the builtins module
    print(_(i"This is a $translated $message"))

Any actual i18n implementation would need to address other issues (most notably
message catalog extraction), but this gives the general idea of what might be
possible.

It's also worth noting that one of the benefits of the ``$`` based substitution
syntax in this PEP is its compatibility with Mozilla's
`l20n syntax <http://l20n.org/>`__, which uses ``{{ name }}`` for global
substitution, and ``{{ $user }}`` for local context substitution.

With the syntax in this PEP, an l20n interpolator could be written as::

    translated = l20n(i"{{ $user }} is running {{ appname }}")

With the syntax proposed in PEP 498 (and neglecting the difficulty of doing
catalog lookups using PEP 498's semantics), the necessary brace escaping would
make the string look like this in order to interpolate the user variable
while preserving all of the expected braces::

    locally_interpolated = f"{{{{ ${user} }}}} is running {{{{ appname }}}}"


Possible integration with the logging module
============================================

One of the challenges with the logging module has been that previously been
unable to devise a reasonable migration strategy away from the use of
printf-style formatting. The runtime parsing and interpolation overhead for
logging messages also poses a problem for extensive logging of runtime events
for monitoring purposes.

While beyond the scope of this initial PEP, interpolation template support
could potentially be added to the logging module's event reporting APIs,
permitting relevant details to be captured using forms like::

    logging.debug(i"Event: $event; Details: $data")
    logging.critical(i"Error: $error; Details: $data")

As the interpolation template is passed in as an ordinary argument, other
keyword arguments also remain available::

    logging.critical(i"Error: $error; Details: $data", exc_info=True)

Discussion
==========

Refer to PEP 498 for additional discussion, as several of the points there
also apply to this PEP.

Deferring support for binary interpolation
------------------------------------------

Supporting binary interpolation with this syntax would be relatively
straightforward (the elements in the parsed fields tuple would just be
byte strings rather than text strings, and the default renderer would be
markedly less useful), but poses a signficant likelihood of producing
confusing type errors when a text interpolator was presented with
binary input.

Since the proposed operator is useful without binary interpolation support, and
such support can be readily added later, further consideration of binary
interpolation is considered out of scope for the current PEP.

Interoperability with str-only interfaces
-----------------------------------------

For interoperability with interfaces that only accept strings, interpolation
templates can be prerendered with ``str``, rather than delegating the rendering
to the called function.

This reflects the key difference from PEP 498, which *always* eagerly applies]
the default rendering, without any convenient way to decide to do something
different.

Preserving the raw template string
----------------------------------

Earlier versions of this PEP failed to make the raw template string available
to interpolators. This greatly complicated the i18n example, as it needed to
reconstruct the original template to pass to the message catalog lookup.

Creating a rich object rather than a global name lookup
-------------------------------------------------------

Earlier versions of this PEP used an ``__interpolate__`` builtin, rather than
a creating a new kind of object for later consumption by interpolation
functions. Creating a rich descriptive object with a useful default renderer
made it much easier to support customisation of the semantics of interpolation.

Relative order of conversion and format specifier in parsed fields
------------------------------------------------------------------

The relative order of the conversion specifier and the format specifier in the
substitution field 5-tuple is defined to match the order they appear in the
format string, which is unfortunately the inverse of the way they appear in the
``string.Formatter.parse`` 4-tuple.

I consider this a design defect in ``string.Formatter.parse``, so I think it's
worth fixing it in for the customer interpolator API, since the tuple already
has other differences (like including both the field position number *and* the
text of the expression).

This PEP also makes the parsed field attributes available by name, so it's
possible to write interpolators without caring about the precise field order
at all.
