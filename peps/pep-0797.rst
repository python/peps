Abstract
========

This PEP introduces a new :func:`~concurrent.interpreters.share` function to
the :mod:`concurrent.interpreters` module, which allows *any* arbitrary object
to be shared for a period of time.

For example::

    from concurrent import interpreters

    with open("spanish_inquisition.txt") as unshareable:
        interp = interpreters.create()
        with interpreters.share(unshareable) as proxy:
            interp.prepare_main(file=proxy)
            interp.exec("file.write('I didn't expect the Spanish Inquisition')")


Motivation
==========

Many Objects Cannot be Shared Between Subinterpreters
-----------------------------------------------------

In Python 3.14, the new :mod:`concurrent.interpreters` module can be used to
create multiple interpreters in a single Python process. This works well for
stateless code (that is, code that doesn't need any external data) and objects
that can be serialized, but it is fairly common for applications to want to use
highly-complex data structures (that cannot be serialized) with their
concurrency.

Currently, :mod:`!concurrent.interpreters` can only share
:ref:`a handful of types <interp-object-sharing>` natively, and then falls back
to the :mod:`pickle` module for other types. This can be very limited, as many
types of objects cannot be pickled.

Rationale
=========

A Fallback for Object Sharing
-----------------------------

A shared object proxy is designed to be a fallback for sharing an object
between interpreters, because it's generally slow and causes increased memory
usage (due to :term:`immortality <immortal>`, which will be discussed more
later). As such, this PEP does not make other mechanisms for sharing objects
(namely, serialization) obsolete. A shared object proxy should only be used as
a last-resort silver bullet for highly complex objects that cannot be
serialized or shared in any other way.

Specification
=============

The ``SharedObjectProxy`` Type
------------------------------

.. class:: concurrent.interpreters.SharedObjectProxy

    A proxy type that allows thread-safe access to an object across multiple
    interpreters. This cannot be constructed from Python; instead, use the
    :func:`~concurrent.interpreters.share` function.

    When interacting with the wrapped object, the proxy will switch to the
    interpreter in which the object was created. Arguments passed to anything
    on the proxy are also wrapped in a new shared object proxy if the type
    isn't natively shareable (so, for example, strings would not be wrapped
    in an object proxy, but file objects would). The same goes for return
    values.

    For thread-safety purposes, an instance of ``SharedObjectProxy`` is
    always :term:`immortal`. This means that it won't be deallocated for the
    lifetime of the interpreter. When an object proxy is done being used, it
    clears its reference to the object that it wraps and allows itself to be
    reused. This prevents extreme memory accumulation.

    In addition, all object proxies have an implicit context that manages them.
    This context is determined by the most recent call to
    :func:`~concurrent.interpreters.share` in the current thread. When the context
    finishes, all object proxies created under that context are cleared, allowing
    them to be reused in a new context.

Thread State Switching
**********************

At the C level, all objects in Python's C API are interacted with through their
type (a pointer to a :c:type:`PyTypeObject`). For example, to call an object,
the interpreter will access the :c:member:`~PyTypeObject.tp_call` field on the
object's type. This is where the magic of a shared object proxy can happen.

The :c:type:`!PyTypeObject` for a shared object proxy must be such a type that
implements wrapping behavior for every single field on the type object
structure. So, going back to ``tp_call``, an object proxy must be able to
"intercept" the call in such a way where the wrapped object's ``tp_call``
slot can be executed without thread-safety issues. This is done by switching
the :term:`attached thread state`.

In the C API, a :term:`thread state` belongs to a certain interpreter, and by
holding an attached thread state, the thread may interact with any object
belonging to its interpreter. This is because holding an attached thread state
implies things like holding the :term:`GIL`, which make object access thread-safe.

.. note::

   On the :term:`free threaded <free threading>` build, it is still required
   to hold an :term:`attached thread state` to interact with objects in the
   C API.

So, with that in mind, the only thing that the object proxy has to do to call
a type slot is hold an attached thread state for the object's interpreter.
This is the fundamental idea of how a shared object proxy works: allow access
from any interpreter, but switch to one the wrapped object needs when a type
slot is called.

Sharing Arguments and Return Values
***********************************

Once the attached thread state has been switched to match a wrapped object's
interpreter, passed arguments and the return value of the slot need to be shared
back to the caller. This is done by first attempting to share them natively
(for example, with objects such as ``True`` or ``False``), and then falling
back to creating a new shared object proxy if all else fails. The new proxy
is given the same context as the current proxy, meaning the newly wrapped object
will be able to be freed once the :func:`~concurrent.interpreters.share` context
is closed.

The Sharing APIs
----------------

.. function:: concurrent.interpreters.share(obj)

    Wrap *obj* in a :class:`~concurrent.interpreters.SharedObjectProxy`,
    allowing it to be used in other interpreter APIs as if it were natively shareable.

    This returns a :term:`context manager`. The resulting object is the proxy
    that can be shared (meaning that *obj* is left unchanged). After the context
    is closed, the proxy will release its reference to *obj* and allow itself to
    be reused for a future call to ``share``.

    If this function is used on an existing shared object proxy, it is assigned
    a new context, preventing it from being cleared when the parent ``share``
    context finishes.

    For example:

    .. code-block:: python

        from concurrent import interpreters

        with open("spanish_inquisition.txt") as unshareable:
            interp = interpreters.create()
            with interpreters.share(unshareable) as proxy:
                interp.prepare_main(file=proxy)
                interp.exec("file.write('I didn't expect the Spanish Inquisition')")


    .. note::

        ``None`` cannot be used with this function, as ``None`` is a special
        value reserved for dead object proxies. Since ``None`` is natively
        shareable, there's no need to pass it to this function anyway.

.. function:: concurrent.interpreters.share_forever(obj)

    Similar to :func:`~concurrent.interpreters.share`, but *does not* give the resulting
    proxy a context, meaning it will live forever (unless a call to ``share``
    explicitly gives the proxy a new lifetime). As such, this function does not
    return a :term:`context manager`.

    For example:

    .. code-block:: python

        from concurrent import interpreters

        with open("spanish_inquisition.txt") as unshareable:
            interp = interpreters.create()
            proxy = interpreters.share_forever(unshareable)
            interp.prepare_main(file=proxy)
            # Note: the bound method object for file.write() will also live
            # forever in a proxy.
            interp.exec("file.write('I didn't expect the Spanish Inquisition')")

    .. warning::

        Proxies created as a result of the returned proxy (for example, bound
        method objects) will also exist for the lifetime of the interpreter,
        which can lead to high memory usage.


Multithreaded Scaling
---------------------

Since an object proxy mostly interacts with an object normally, there shouldn't
be much additional overhead on using the object once the thread state has been
switched. However, this means that when the :term:`GIL` is enabled, you may lose
some of the concurrency benefits from subinterpreters, because threads will be
stuck waiting on the GIL for a wrapped object.

Backwards Compatibility
=======================

In order to implement the immortality mechanism used by shared object proxies,
several assumptions had to be made about the object lifecycle in the C API.
So, some best practices in the C API (such as using the object allocator for
objects) are made harder requirements by the implementation of this PEP.

The author of this PEP believes it is unlikely that this will cause breakage,
as he has not ever seen code in the wild that violates the assumptions made
about the object lifecycle as required by the reference implementation.

Security Implications
=====================

The largest issue with shared object proxies is that in order to have
thread-safe reference counting operations, they must be :term:`immortal`,
which prevents any concurrent modification to their reference count.
This can cause them to take up very large amounts of memory if mismanaged.

The :func:`~concurrent.interpreters.share` context manager does its best
to avoid this issue by manually clearing references at the end of an object
proxy's usage (allowing mortal objects to be freed), as well as avoiding
the allocation of new object proxies by reusing dead ones (that is, object
proxies with a cleared reference).

How to Teach This
=================

New APIs and important information about how to use them will be added to the
:mod:`concurrent.interpreters` documentation. An informational PEP regarding
the new immortality mechanisms included in the reference implementation will
be written if this PEP is accepted.

Reference Implementation

Rejected Ideas
==============

Why Not Atomic Reference Counting?
----------------------------------

Immortality seems to be the driver for a lot of complexity in this proposal;
why not use atomic reference counting instead?

Atomic reference counting has been tried before in previous :term:`GIL`
removal attempts, but unfortunately added too much overhead to CPython to be
feasible, because atomic "add" operations are much slower than their non-atomic
counterparts. Immortality, while complex, has the benefit of being efficient
and thread-safe without needing to slow down single-threaded performance with
reference counting.
