Abstract
========

This PEP specifies how to write a project's external, or non-PyPI, build and
runtime dependencies in a ``pyproject.toml`` file for packaging-related tools
to consume.

This PEP proposes to add an ``[external]`` table to ``pyproject.toml`` with
three keys: "build-requires", "host-requires" and "dependencies". These
are for specifying three types of dependencies:

1. ``build-requires``, build tools to run on the build machine
2. ``host-requires``, build dependencies needed for host machine but also needed at build time.
3. ``dependencies``, needed at runtime on the host machine but not needed at build time.

Cross compilation is taken into account by distinguishing build and host dependencies.
Optional build-time and runtime dependencies are supported too, in a manner analogies
to how that is supported in the ``[project]`` table.


Motivation
==========

Python packages may have dependencies on build tools, libraries, command-line
tools, or other software that is not present on PyPI. Currently there is no way
to express those dependencies in standardized metadata
[#singular-vision-native-deps]_, [#pypacking-native-deps]_. Key motivators for
this PEP are to:

- Enable tools to automatically map external dependencies to packages in other
  packaging repositories,
- Make it possible to include needed dependencies in error messages emitting by
  Python package installers and build frontends,
- Provide a canonical place for package authors to record this dependency
  information.

Packaging ecosystems like Linux distros, Conda, Homebrew, Spack, and Nix need
full sets of dependencies for Python packages, and have tools like pyp2spec_
(Fedora), Grayskull_ (Conda), and dh_python_ (Debian) which attempt to
automatically generate dependency metadata for their own package managers from the metadata in
upstream Python packages. External dependencies are currently handled manually,
because there is no metadata for this in ``pyproject.toml`` or any other
standard location. Enabling automating this conversion is a key benefit of
this PEP, making packaging Python packages for distros easier and more reliable. In addition, the
authors envision other types of tools making use of this information, e.g.,
dependency analysis tools like Repology_, Dependabot_ and libraries.io_.
Software bill of materials (SBOM) generation tools may also be able to use this
information, e.g. for flagging that external dependencies listed in
``pyproject.toml`` but not contained in wheel metadata are likely vendored
within the wheel.

Packages with external dependencies are typically hard to build from source,
and error messages from build failures tend to be hard to decipher for end
users. Missing external dependencies on the end user's system are the most
likely cause of build failures. If installers can show the required external
dependencies as part of their error message, this may save users a lot of time.

At the moment, information on external dependencies is only captured in
installation documentation of individual packages. It is hard to maintain for
package authors and tends to go out of date. It's also hard for users and
distro packagers to find it. Having a canonical place to record this dependency
information will improve this situation.

This PEP is not trying to specify how the external dependencies should be used,
nor a mechanism to implement a name mapping from names of individual packages
that are canonical for Python projects published on PyPI to those of other
packaging ecosystems. Those topics should be addressed in separate PEPs.


Rationale
=========

Types of external dependencies
------------------------------

Multiple types of external dependencies can be distinguished:

- Concrete packages that can be identified by name and have a canonical
  location in another language-specific package repository. E.g., Rust
  packages on `crates.io <https://crates.io/>`__, R packages on
  `CRAN <https://cran.r-project.org/>`__, JavaScript packages on the
  `npm registry <https://www.npmjs.com/>`__.
- Concrete packages that can be identified by name but do not have a clear
  canonical location. This is typically the case for libraries and tools
  written in C, C++, Fortran, CUDA and other low-level languages. E.g.,
  Boost, OpenSSL, Protobuf, Intel MKL, GCC.
- "Virtual" packages, which are names for concepts, types of tools or
  interfaces. These typically have multiple implementations, which *are*
  concrete packages. E.g., a C++ compiler, BLAS, LAPACK, OpenMP, MPI.

Concrete packages are straightforward to understand, and are a concept present
in virtually every package management system. Virtual packages are a concept
also present in a number of packaging systems -- but not always, and the
details of their implementation varies.

Cross compilation
-----------------

Cross compilation is not yet (as of August 2023) well-supported by stdlib
modules and ``pyproject.toml`` metadata. It is however important when
translating external dependencies to those of other packaging systems (with
tools like ``pyp2spec``). Introducing support for cross compilation immediately
in this PEP is much easier than extending ``[external]`` in the future, hence
the authors choose to include this now.

Terminology
'''''''''''

This PEP uses the following terminology:

- *build machine*: the machine on which the package build process is being
  executed
- *host machine*: the machine on which the produced artifact will be installed
  and run
- *build dependency*: dependency for building the package that needs to be
  present at build time and itself was built for the build machine's OS and
  architecture
- *host dependency*: dependency for building the package that needs to be
  present at build time and itself was built for the host machine's OS and
  architecture

Note that this terminology is not consistent across build and packaging tools,
so care must be taken when comparing build/host dependencies in
``pyproject.toml`` to dependencies from other package managers.

Note that "target machine" or "target dependency" is not used in this PEP. That
is typically only relevant for cross-compiling compilers or other such advanced
scenarios [#gcc-cross-terminology]_, [#meson-cross]_ - this is out of scope for
this PEP.

Finally, note that while "dependency" is the term most widely used for packages
needed at build time, the existing key in ``pyproject.toml`` for PyPI
build-time dependencies is ``build-requires``. Hence this PEP uses the keys
``build-requires`` and ``host-requires`` under ``[external]`` for consistency.

Build and host dependencies
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Clear separation of metadata associated with the definition of build and target
platforms, rather than assuming that build and target platform will always be
the same, is important [#pypackaging-native-cross]_.

Build dependencies are typically run during the build process - they may be
compilers, code generators, or other such tools. In case the use of a build
dependency implies a runtime dependency, that runtime dependency does not have
to be declared explicitly. For example, when compiling Fortran code with
``gfortran`` into a Python extension module, the package likely incurs a
dependency on the ``libgfortran`` runtime library. The rationale for not
explicitly listing such runtime dependencies is two-fold: (1) it may depend on
compiler/linker flags or details of the build environment whether the
dependency is present, and (2) these runtime dependencies can be detected and
handled automatically by tools like ``auditwheel``.

Host dependencies are typically not run during the build process, but only used
for linking against. This is not a rule though -- it may be possible or
necessary to run a host dependency under an emulator, or through a custom tool
like crossenv_. When host dependencies imply a runtime dependency, that runtime
dependency also does not have to be declared, just like for build dependencies.

When host dependencies are declared and a tool is not cross-compilation aware
and has to do something with external dependencies, the tool MAY merge the
``host-requires`` list into ``build-requires``. This may for example happen if
an installer like ``pip`` starts reporting external dependencies as a likely
cause of a build failure when a package fails to build from an sdist.

Specifying external dependencies
--------------------------------

Concrete package specification through PURL
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The two types of concrete packages are supported by PURL_ (Package URL), which
implements a scheme for identifying packages that is meant to be portable
across packaging ecosystems. Its design is::

    scheme:type/namespace/name@version?qualifiers#subpath

The ``scheme`` component is a fixed string, ``pkg``, and of the other
components only ``type`` and ``name`` are required. As an example, a package
URL for the ``requests`` package on PyPI would be::

    pkg:pypi/requests

Adopting PURL to specify external dependencies in ``pyproject.toml`` solves a
number of problems at once - and there are already implementations of the
specification in Python and multiple languages. PURL is also already supported
by dependency-related tooling like SPDX (see
`External Repository Identifiers in the SPDX 2.3 spec <https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2.3/external-repository-identifiers/#f35-purl>`__),
the `Open Source Vulnerability format <https://ossf.github.io/osv-schema/#affectedpackage-field>`__,
and the `Sonatype OSS Index <https://ossindex.sonatype.org/doc/coordinates>`__;
not having to wait years before support in such tooling arrives is valuable.

For concrete packages without a canonical package manager to refer to, either
``pkg:generic/pkg-name`` can be used, or a direct reference to the VCS system
that the package is maintained in (e.g.,
``pkg:github/user-or-org-name/pkg-name``). Which of these is more appropriate
is situation-dependent. This PEP recommends using ``pkg:generic`` when the
package name is unambiguous and well-known (e.g., ``pkg:generic/git`` or
``pkg:generic/openblas``), and using the VCS as the PURL type otherwise.

Virtual package specification
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

There is no ready-made support for virtual packages in PURL or another
standard. There are a relatively limited number of such dependencies though,
and adopting a scheme similar to PURL but with the ``virtual:`` rather than
``pkg:`` scheme seems like it will be understandable and map well to Linux
distros with virtual packages and to the likes of Conda and Spack.

The two known virtual package types are ``compiler`` and ``interface``.

Versioning
''''''''''

Support in PURL for version expressions and ranges beyond a fixed version is
still pending, see the Open Issues section.

Dependency specifiers
'''''''''''''''''''''

Regular Python dependency specifiers (as originally defined in :pep:`508`) may
be used behind PURLs. PURL qualifiers, which use ``?`` followed by a package
type-specific dependency specifier component, must not be used. The reason for
this is pragmatic: dependency specifiers are already used for other metadata in
``pyproject.toml``, any tooling that is used with ``pyproject.toml`` is likely
to already have a robust implementation to parse it. And we do not expect to
need the extra possibilities that PURL qualifiers provide (e.g. to specify a
Conan or Conda channel, or a RubyGems platform).

Usage of core metadata fields
-----------------------------

The `core metadata`_ specification contains one relevant field, namely
``Requires-External``. This has no well-defined semantics in core metadata 2.1;
this PEP chooses to reuse the field for external runtime dependencies. The core
metadata specification does not contain fields for any metadata in
``pyproject.toml``'s ``[build-system]`` table. Therefore the ``build-requires``
and ``host-requires`` content also does not need to be reflected in core
metadata fields. The ``optional-dependencies`` content from ``[external]``
would need to either reuse ``Provides-Extra`` or require a new
``Provides-External-Extra`` field. Neither seems desirable.

Differences between sdist and wheel metadata
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

A wheel may vendor its external dependencies. This happens in particular when
distributing wheels on PyPI or other Python package indexes - and tools like
auditwheel_, delvewheel_ and delocate_ automate this process. As a result, a
``Requires-External`` entry in an sdist may disappear from a wheel built from
that sdist. It is also possible that a ``Requires-External`` entry remains in a
wheel, either unchanged or with narrower constraints. ``auditwheel`` does not
vendor certain allow-listed dependencies, such as OpenGL, by default. In
addition, ``auditwheel`` and ``delvewheel`` allow a user to manually exclude
dependencies via a ``--exclude`` or ``--no-dll`` command-line flag. This is
used to avoid vendoring large shared libraries, for example those from CUDA.

``Requires-External`` entries generated from external dependencies in
``pyproject.toml`` in a wheel are therefore allowed to be narrower than those
for the corresponding sdist. They must not be wider, i.e. constraints must not
allow a version of a dependency for a wheel that isn't allowed for an sdist,
nor contain new dependencies that are not listed in the sdist's metadata at
all.

Canonical names of dependencies and ``-dev(el)`` split packages
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

It is fairly common for distros to split a package into two or more packages.
In particular, runtime components are often separately installable from
development components (headers, pkg-config and CMake files, etc.). The latter
then typically has a name with ``-dev`` or ``-devel`` appended to the
project/library name. This split is the responsibility of each distro to
maintain, and should not be reflected in the ``[external]`` table. It is not
possible to specify this in a reasonable way that works across distros, hence
only the canonical name should be used in ``[external]``.

The intended meaning of using a PURL or virtual dependency is "the full package
with the name specified". It will depend on the context in which the metadata
is used whether the split is relevant. For example, if ``libffi`` is a host
dependency and a tool wants to prepare an environment for building a wheel,
then if a distro has split off the headers for ``libffi`` into a
``libffi-devel`` package then the tool has to install both ``libffi`` and
``libffi-devel``.

Python development headers
''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Python headers and other build support files may also be split. This is the
same situation as in the section above (because Python is simply a regular
package in distros). *However*, a ``python-dev|devel`` dependency is special because
in ``pyproject.toml`` Python itself is an implicit rather than an explicit
dependency. Hence a choice needs to be made here - add ``python-dev`` implicitly,
or make each package author add it explicitly under ``[external]``. For
consistency between Python dependencies and external dependencies, we choose to
add it implicitly. Python development headers must be assumed to be necessary
when an ``[external]`` table contains one or more compiler packages.


Specification
=============

If metadata is improperly specified then tools MUST raise an error to notify
the user about their mistake.

Details
-------

Note that ``pyproject.toml`` content is in the same format as in :pep:`621`.

Table name
''''''''''

Tools MUST specify fields defined by this PEP in a table named ``[external]``.
No tools may add fields to this table which are not defined by this PEP or
subsequent PEPs. The lack of an ``[external]`` table means the package either
does not have any external dependencies, or the ones it does have are assumed
to be present on the system already.

``build-requires``/``optional-build-requires``
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

- Format: Array of PURL_ strings (``build-requires``) and a table
  with values of arrays of PURL_ strings (``optional-build-requires``)
- `Core metadata`_: N/A

The (optional) external build requirements needed to build the project.

For ``build-requires``, it is a key whose value is an array of strings. Each
string represents a build requirement of the project and MUST be formatted as
either a valid PURL_ string or a ``virtual:`` string.

For ``optional-build-requires``, it is a table where each key specifies an
extra set of build requirements and whose value is an array of strings. The
strings of the arrays MUST be valid PURL_ strings.

``host-requires``/``optional-host-requires``
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

- Format: Array of PURL_ strings (``host-requires``) and a table
  with values of arrays of PURL_ strings (``optional-host-requires``)
- `Core metadata`_: N/A

The (optional) external host requirements needed to build the project.

For ``host-requires``, it is a key whose value is an array of strings. Each
string represents a host requirement of the project and MUST be formatted as
either a valid PURL_ string or a ``virtual:`` string.

For ``optional-host-requires``, it is a table where each key specifies an
extra set of host requirements and whose value is an array of strings. The
strings of the arrays MUST be valid PURL_ strings.

``dependencies``/``optional-dependencies``
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

- Format: Array of PURL_ strings (``dependencies``) and a table
  with values of arrays of PURL_ strings (``optional-dependencies``)
- `Core metadata`_: ``Requires-External``, N/A

The (optional) runtime dependencies of the project.

For ``dependencies``, it is a key whose value is an array of strings. Each
string represents a dependency of the project and MUST be formatted as either a
valid PURL_ string or a ``virtual:`` string. Each string maps directly to a
``Requires-External`` entry in the `core metadata`_.

For ``optional-dependencies``, it is a table where each key specifies an extra
and whose value is an array of strings. The strings of the arrays MUST be valid
PURL_ strings. Optional dependencies do not map to a core metadata field.

      # dependency from wheel metadata.
      "pkg:github/AbiWord/enchant",
    ]


Backwards Compatibility
=======================

There is no impact on backwards compatibility, as this PEP only adds new,
optional metadata. In the absence of such metadata, nothing changes for package
authors or packaging tooling.


Security Implications
=====================

There are no direct security concerns as this PEP covers how to statically
define metadata for external dependencies. Any security issues would stem from
how tools consume the metadata and choose to act upon it.


How to Teach This
=================

External dependencies and if and how those external dependencies are vendored
are topics that are typically not understood in detail by Python package
authors. We intend to start from how an external dependency is defined, the
different ways it can be depended on---from runtime-only with ``ctypes`` or a
``subprocess`` call to it being a build dependency that's linked against---
before going into how to declare external dependencies in metadata. The
documentation should make explicit what is relevant for package authors, and
what for distro packagers.

Material on this topic will be added to the most relevant packaging tutorials,
primarily the `Python Packaging User Guide`_. In addition, we expect that any
build backend that adds support for external dependencies metadata will include
information about that in its documentation, as will tools like ``auditwheel``.


Reference Implementation
========================

This PEP contains a metadata specification, rather that a code feature - hence
there will not be code implementing the metadata spec as a whole. However,
there are parts that do have a reference implementation:

1. The ``[external]`` table has to be valid TOML and therefore can be loaded
   with ``tomllib``.
2. The PURL specification, as a key part of this spec, has a Python package
   with a reference implementation for constructing and parsing PURLs:
   `packageurl-python`_.

There are multiple possible consumers and use cases of this metadata, once
that metadata gets added to Python packages. Tested metadata for all of the
top 150 most-downloaded packages from PyPI with published platform-specific
wheels can be found in `rgommers/external-deps-build`_. This metadata has
been validated by using it to build wheels from sdists patched with that
metadata in clean Docker containers.


Rejected Ideas
==============

Specific syntax for external dependencies which are also packaged on PyPI
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are non-Python packages which are packaged on PyPI, such as Ninja,
patchelf and CMake. What is typically desired is to use the system version of
those, and if it's not present on the system then install the PyPI package for
it. The authors believe that specific support for this scenario is not
necessary (or too complex to justify such support); a dependency provider for
external dependencies can treat PyPI as one possible source for obtaining the
package.

Using library and header names as external dependencies
-------------------------------------------------------

A previous draft PEP (`"External dependencies" (2015) <https://github.com/pypa/interoperability-peps/pull/30>`__)
proposed using specific library and header names as external dependencies. This
is too granular; using package names is a well-established pattern across
packaging ecosystems and should be preferred.


Open Issues
===========

Version specifiers for PURLs
----------------------------

Support in PURL for version expressions and ranges is still pending. The pull
request at `vers implementation for PURL`_ seems close to being merged, at
which point this PEP could adopt it.

Versioning of virtual dependencies
----------------------------------

Once PURL supports version expressions, virtual dependencies can be versioned
with the same syntax. It must be better specified however what the version
scheme is, because this is not as clear for virtual dependencies as it is for
PURLs (e.g., there can be multiple implementations, and abstract interfaces may
not be unambiguously versioned). E.g.:

- OpenMP: has regular ``MAJOR.MINOR`` versions of its standard, so would look
  like ``>=4.5``.
- BLAS/LAPACK: should use the versioning used by `Reference LAPACK`_, which
  defines what the standard APIs are. Uses ``MAJOR.MINOR.MICRO``, so would look
  like ``>=3.10.0``.
- Compilers: these implement language standards. For C, C++ and Fortran these
  are versioned by year. In order for versions to sort correctly, we choose to
  use the full year (four digits). So "at least C99" would be ``>=1999``, and
  selecting C++14 or Fortran 77 would be ``==2014`` or ``==1977`` respectively.
  Other languages may use different versioning schemes. These should be
  described somewhere before they are used in ``pyproject.toml``.

A logistical challenge is where to describe the versioning - given that this
will evolve over time, this PEP itself is not the right location for it.
Instead, this PEP should point at that (to be created) location.

Who defines canonical names and canonical package structure?
------------------------------------------------------------

Similarly to the logistics around versioning is the question about what names
are allowed and where they are described. And then who is in control of that
description and responsible for maintaining it. Our tentative answer is: there
should be a central list for virtual dependencies and ``pkg:generic`` PURLs,
maintained as a PyPA project. See
https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-725-specifying-external-dependencies-in-pyproject-toml/31888/62.
TODO: once that list/project is prototyped, include it in the PEP and close
this open issue.

Syntax for virtual dependencies
-------------------------------

The current syntax this PEP uses for virtual dependencies is
``virtual:type/name``, which is analogous to but not part of the PURL spec.
This open issue discusses supporting virtual dependencies within PURL:
`purl-spec#222 <https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec/issues/222>`__.

Should a ``host-requires`` key be added under ``[build-system]``?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Adding ``host-requires`` for host dependencies that are on PyPI in order to
better support name mapping to other packaging systems with support for
cross-compiling may make sense.
`This issue <https://github.com/rgommers/peps/issues/6>`__ tracks this topic
and has arguments in favor and against adding ``host-requires`` under
``[build-system]`` as part of this PEP.
