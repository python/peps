Abstract
========

:pep:`508` specifies a mini-language for
declaring package dependencies. One feature of this language is the ability to
specify *extras*, which are optional components of a distribution that, when
used, install additional dependencies. This PEP proposes a mechanism to allow
one or more extras to be installed by default if none are provided explicitly.

Motivation
==========

Various use cases for default extras and possible solutions in this PEP were discussed
extensively on `this DPO thread <https://discuss.python.org/t/adding-a-default-extra-require-environment/4898>`__.
These fall into two broad cases that that provide the
motivation for the present PEP.

Recommended but not required dependencies
-----------------------------------------

Package maintainers often use extras to declare optional dependencies that
extend the functionality or performance of a package. In some cases, it can be
difficult to determine which dependencies should be required and which should be
categorized as extras. A balance must be struck between the needs of typical
users (who may prefer most features to be available 'by default') and users who
want minimal installations without large, optional dependencies. One solution
with existing Python packaging infrastructure is for package maintainers to
define an extra called, for example, ``recommended``, which
includes all non-essential but suggested dependencies. Users are then instructed to
install the package using ``package[recommended]``, while those who prefer more
control can use ``package``. However, in practice, many users are unaware
of the ``[recommended]`` syntax, placing the burden on them to know this for a
typical installation. Having a way to have recommended dependencies be installed
by default while providing a way for users to request a more minimal installation
would satisfy this use case, and the present PEP will describe a solution to this.

Real-world examples of packages that encourage users to include extra
dependencies by default include for example:

* `astropy <https://www.astropy.org/>`_, a core package for astronomy, which
  recommends that users install ``astropy[recommended]``. Some of the
  dependencies in ``recommended``, such as `scipy <http://www.scipy.org>`_, are
  used in a number of places in astropy for common
  functionality and scipy should ideally be a required dependency, but there has
  been reluctance to so as it is not a lightweight dependency and advanced users
  who want minimal installs want the ability to opt out of it (however, as
  described above, this places a burden on the majority of regular uses to
  satisfy a use case for advanced users).
* `fastapi <https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/>`_, a web framework, which recommends
  that users install ``fastapi[standard]`` in order to include commonly needed
  dependencies.
* `tensorflow <https://www.tensorflow.org>`_, a machine learning platform, which
  recommends that users install ``tensorflow[and-cuda]`` since CUDA support is
  commonly needed by users.

Packages supporting multiple backends or frontends
--------------------------------------------------

Another common use case for using extras is to define different backends or
frontends and dependencies that need to be installed for each backend or
frontend. A package might need at least one backend or frontend to be installed
in order to be functional, but may be flexible on which backend or frontend this
is. Concrete examples of such frontends or backends include:

* The Qt frontend library, which requires either PySide or PyQt to be installed
* BLAS/LAPACK, which have different possible implementations (e.g. OpenBLAS, and MKL)
* FFT libraries, which also have different implementations (e.g. ``scipy.fft`` and pyFFTW)

With current packaging standards, maintainers have to either
require one of the backends or frontends, or require users
to always specify extras, e.g. ``package[backend]`` and therefore risk users
having an unusable installation if they only install ``package``. Having a
way to specify one or more default backend or frontend and providing a way to
override these defaults would provide a much better experience for users, and
the approach described in this PEP will allow this.

Note that this PEP does not aim to address the issue of disallowing conflicting
or incompatible extras - for example if a package requires exactly one frontend
or backend package. There is currently no mechanism in Python packaging
infrastructure to disallow conflicting or incompatible extras to be installed,
and this PEP does not change that.

Real-world examples of packages that allow users to select different backends or
frontends with extras include:

* `kivy <https://kivy.org/>`_, an app development framework, which supports
  various backends for e.g. text, image, video, and needs at least one backend
  to be installed in order to be functional. Currently the solution is to
  recommend that users install ``kivy[base]``

* `napari <https://napari.org>`_, an interactive viewer for multi-dimensional images
  which can work with either `PyQt5 <https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/>`_, `PyQt6
  <https://pypi.org/project/PyQt6/>`_, `PySide2
  <https://pypi.org/project/PySide2/>`_, or `PySide6
  <https://pypi.org/project/PySide6/>`_ for the frontend, and will not work if none of them are
  installed. Users are instructed to install ``napari[all]`` for an easy installation
  which will include one of the frontends, and have the option to explicitly
  install a different frontend by doing e.g. ``napari[pyside2]``.

* `glueviz <https://www.glueviz.org>`_, a data visualization application which
  can also use different Qt frontends as for napari, and will not work if none
  of them are installed. Users are instructed to install ``glueviz[qt]`` to
  include one of the Qt backends by default.

In all three cases, installing the package without any extras results in a
broken installation (and this is a commonly reported issue for some of these
packages).

Rationale
=========

A number of possible solutions have been extensively and vigorously discussed by
the community for several years, including in `this DPO thread
<https://discuss.python.org/t/adding-a-default-extra-require-environment/4898/38>`__
as well as in numerous issues and pull requests. The solution that will be
presented below:

* is an opt-in solution which means that package maintainers can choose whether or not to use it
* is flexible enough to accommodate both of the major use cases described in `Motivation`_
* does not introduce new syntax compared to :pep:`508` (which would have serious backward-compatibility implications)

It is the only solution out of all those discussed that meets all three criteria.

Specification
=============

``Default-Extra`` Metadata Field
---------------------------------

A new multiple-use metadata field, ``Default-Extra``, will be added to the `core package
metadata <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/core-metadata/#core-metadata>`_.
For this field, each entry must be a string specifying an extra that will be
automatically included when the package is installed without any extras specified explicitly.

Only entries already specified in a `Provides-Extra
<https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/core-metadata/#provides-extra-multiple-use>`_
entry can be used in a ``Default-Extra`` entry.

Examples::

    Default-Extra: recommended
    Default-Extra: backend1
    Default-Extra: backend2
    Default-Extra: backend3

Since this introduces a new field in the core package metadata, this will require
`Metadata-Version <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/core-metadata/#metadata-version>`_
to be bumped to the next minor version (2.5 at the time of writing).

New key in ``[project]`` metadata table
---------------------------------------

A new key will be added to the ``[project]`` table in project metadata as
originally defined in :pep:`621` and now defined in the `PyPA specifications
<https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/pyproject-toml/>`_. This key will be named
``default-optional-dependency-keys`` with the following description:

* `TOML <https://toml.io/>`_ type: Array of strings
* Corresponding core metadata field: ``Default-Extra``

Each string in ``default-optional-dependency-keys`` must be the name of an extra
defined in `optional-dependencies
<https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/pyproject-toml/#dependencies-optional-dependencies>`_,
and each extra in this array will be converted to a matching ``Default-Extra``
entry in the core package metadata. Examples of valid usage which would
produce the example ``Default-Extra`` entries presented in the previous section are:

.. code-block:: toml

    [project]
    default-optional-dependency-keys = [
        "recommended",
    ]

and:

.. code-block:: toml

    [project]
    default-optional-dependency-keys = [
        "backend1",
        "backend2",
        "backend3"
    ]


Overriding default extras
-------------------------

If extras are explicitly given in a dependency specification, the default
extras are not installed. Otherwise, the default extras are used.

For example, if a package
defines an ``extra1`` default extra as well as a non-default ``extra2``
extra, then if a user were to install the package with:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install package

the ``extra1`` dependency would be included. If the user instead uses:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install package[extra2]

then the ``extra1`` extra would not be installed.

If the same package is specified multiple times in an installation command or
dependency tree, the default extras must be installed if any of the instances of
the package are specified without extras. For instance:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install package package[extra2]

should install the default extras.

Note that ``package[]`` would continue to be equivalent to ``package`` and would
not be provided as a way to install without default extras (see the `Rejected
Ideas`_ section for the rationale).

We also note that some tools such as `pip`_ currently ignore unrecognized
extras, and emit a warning to the user to indicate that the extra has not been
recognized. In this case, if no extras are recognized as being valid in a
dependency specification, we recommend that this case be treated as if the user
had not passed any explicit extras, and therefore any default extras should be
installed.

Installing without default extras
---------------------------------

In some cases, package maintainers may want to facilitate installing packages
without any default extras. In this case, as will be shown in more detail in
`How to teach this`_, the best approach is to define an extra which could be
called e.g. ``minimal`` or ``nodefault`` (the naming would be up to the package
maintainer) which would be an empty set of dependencies. If this extra is
specified, no default extras will be included, so that e.g. ``package[minimal]``
would include only required dependencies and no extras. Note that this requires
no additional specification and is a natural consequence of the rule described
in `Overriding default extras`_.

There are however valid use cases where package maintainers may not want to
provide this. For example, in the case of the multiple possible frontends or
backends, it may be that the package would not be functional without any of the
options. To take a specific example, a package may need either PyQt or PySide to
be installed but will not work if none are provided, so a package maintainer may
therefore not want to provide an option to install the package without any
extras.

Backward Compatibility
======================

There are several different aspects related to backward compatibility that need
to be considered.

Packages not using default extras
---------------------------------

Once support for this PEP is added to tools in the packaging ecosystem, packages
that do not make use of default extras will continue to work as-is and there
should be no break in compatibility.

Packages using default extras
-----------------------------

Once packages start defining default extras, those defaults will only be honored
with recent versions of packaging tools which implement this PEP, but those
packages will remain installable with older packaging tools -- with the main
difference being that the default extras will not be installed automatically
when older packaging tools are used. As described in `How to teach this`_,
package authors need to carefully evaluate when and how they adopt
the default extra feature depending on their user base, as some actions (such as
moving a required dependency to a default extra) will likely result in breakage
for users if a significant fraction of them are still using older package
installers that do not support default extras. In this sense, package authors
should be aware that this feature, if used in certain ways, can cause
backward-compatibility issues for users, and they are thus responsible for
ensuring that they minimize the impact to users.

Packaging-related tools
-----------------------

The most significant backward-compatibility aspect is related to assumptions
pakaging tools make about extras -- specifically, this PEP changes the
assumption that extras are no longer exclusively additive in terms of adding
dependencies to the dependency tree, and specifying some extras can result in
fewer dependencies being installed.

A specific example of change in behavior can be seen with `pip`_: consider a
package ``package`` which has a required dependency of ``numpy``, a (default)
extra called ``recommended`` which includes ``scipy``, and a ``minimal`` extra
which does not contain any dependencies. If a user installs ``package[minimal]``,
only ``package`` and ``numpy`` will be installed. If a user then does:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip freeze > requirements.txt

then ``requirements.txt`` will contain e.g.::

    package==1.0.2
    numpy==2.1.0

However, if the user then installs the requirements from this file using:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

then pip will install ``package`` (which will include the default extra) as well
as ``numpy``, so the final environment will contain ``scipy``. A solution in this
specific case is for the user to pass ``--no-deps`` to ``pip install`` to avoid
resolving the dependency tree, but the point here is to illustrate that there
may be changes in behavior in packaging tools due to the change in the
assumption about what impact an extra can have.

Security Implications
=====================

There are no known security implications for this PEP.

Examples of usage
=================

The rule in `Overriding default extras`_ regarding only installing default extras
when no extras are explicitly specified, combined with the introduction of the
``Default-Extra:`` keyword and ``default-optional-dependency-keys`` metadata key
allows us to address several different use cases. Below we take a look at the
specific use cases raised in the `Motivation`_ section and how these
can be addressed as a result of the changes described in `Specification`_.

Recommended dependencies and minimal installations
--------------------------------------------------

First, we consider the case of packages that want recommended
but not strictly required dependencies installed by default, while also
providing a way to only install the required dependencies.

In order to do this, a package maintainer would define an extra called
``recommended`` containing the recommended but not required dependencies, and
would choose to have this be included as a default extra:

.. code-block:: toml

    [project]
    default-optional-dependency-keys = [
        "recommended"
    ]

    [project.optional-dependencies]
    recommended = [
        "package1",
        "package2"
    ]

In this specific case, a package maintainer may want to allow users to also
install the package without the recommended dependencies, in which case they
could define an empty extra:

.. code-block:: toml

    [project.optional-dependencies]
    minimal = []
    recommended = [
        "package1",
        "package2"
    ]

This would then allow users to install ``package[minimal]`` which, since
there would be an extra explicitly specified, would mean the default extra
does not get installed, and since the ``minimal`` extra is empty, no
additional dependencies would be installed.

Maintainers would have the choice as to whether to offer the capability to do a
minimal installation or not - in some cases, such as highlighted in the next
section, this might not be desirable.

To take one of the concrete examples from the `Motivation`_ section, the
`astropy`_ package could declare the existing ``recommended``
extra as a default extra and provide a ``minimal`` extra:

.. code-block:: toml

    [project]
    default-optional-dependency-keys = [
        "recommended"
    ]

    [project.optional-dependencies]
    minimal = []
    recommended = [
        "scipy",
        "..."
    ]

meaning that installing:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install astropy

would then get optional but important optional dependencies such as `scipy`_
would get installed. Advanced users who want a minimal install could then use:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install astropy[minimal]


Packages requiring at least one backend or frontend
---------------------------------------------------

As described in `Motivation`_, some packages may support multiple backends
and/or frontends, and in some cases it may be desirable to ensure that there
is always at least one backend or frontend package installed, as the package
would be unusable otherwise. Concrete examples of this might include a GUI
application that needs a GUI library to be present to be usable but is able
to support different ones, or a package that can rely on different computational
backends but needs at least one to be installed.

In this case, package maintainers could make the choice to define an extra
for each backend or frontend, and provide a default, e.g.:

.. code-block:: toml

    [project]
    default-optional-dependency-keys = [
        "backend1"
    ]

    [project.optional-dependencies]
    backend1 = [
        "package1",
        "package2"
    ]
    backend2 = [
        "package3"
    ]

Unlike the previous example however, maintainers would not necessarily provide a
way to do an installation without any extras since it might leave the package in
an unusable state.

If packages can support e.g. multiple backends at the same time, and some of
the backends should always be installed, then the dependencies for these must be given
as required dependencies rather than using the default extras mechanism.

To take one of the concrete examples mentioned in `Motivation`_, the `napari`_ package
could define a configuration such as:

.. code-block:: toml

    [project]
    default-optional-dependency-keys = [
        "pyqt5"
    ]

    [project.optional-dependencies]
    pyqt5 = [
        "PyQt5",
        "..."
    ]
    pyside2 = [
        "PySide2",
        "..."
    ]
    pyqt6 = [
        "PyQt6",
        "..."
    ]
    pyside6 = [
        "PySide6",
        "..."
    ]

meaning that:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install napari

would work out-of-the-box, but there would be a mechanism for users to explicitly
specify a frontend, e.g.:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install napari[pyside6]

Supporting minimal installations while not always removing default extras
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

An additional case we consider here is where a package maintainer wants to support
minimal installations without any extras, but also wants to support having users
specify additional extras without removing the default one. Essentially, they
would want:

* ``package[minimal]`` to give an installation without any extras
* ``package`` to install recommended dependencies (in a ``recommended`` extras)
* ``package[additional]`` to install both recommended and additional dependencies (in an ``additional`` extras)

This could be achieved with e.g:

.. code-block:: toml

    [project]
    default-optional-dependency-keys = [
        "recommended"
    ]

    [project.optional-dependencies]
    minimal = []
    recommended = [
        "package1",
        "package2"
    ]
    additional = [
        "package[recommended]",
        "package3"
    ]

The ability for a package to reference itself in the extras is supported by
existing Python packaging tools.

Once again taking a concrete example from `Motivation`_, astropy defines several
other extras, including for example ``jupyter``, which adds packages that
enhance the user experience inside `Jupyter <https://jupyter.org/>`_-based
environments. However, it is likely that users opting in to this extra would still
want recommended dependencies to be installed. The following configuration
would solve this case:

.. code-block:: toml

    [project]
    default-optional-dependency-keys = [
        "recommended"
    ]

    [project.optional-dependencies]
    minimal = []
    recommended = [
        "scipy",
        "..."
    ]
    jupyter = [
        "astropy[recommended]",
        "ipywidgets",
        "..."
    ]

Users installing:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install astropy[jupyter]

would then get the same as:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install astropy[recommended, jupyter]

How to teach this
=================

Package authors
---------------

While the mechanism used to define extras and the associated rule about when to
use it are simple, package authors need to carefully consider several points
before adopting this capability in their packages, as this has implications for
backward-compatibility.

Supporting older versions of package installers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Package installers such as `pip`_ or `uv <https://docs.astral.sh/uv/>`_ will not
necessarily implement support for default extras at the same time, and once they
do it is likely that package authors will want to keep supporting users who do
not have the most recent version of a package installer. In this case, the
following recommendations would apply:

* Moving a package from being a required dependency to a default extra would be
  a breaking change, because older versions of package installers would not
  recognise the concept of default extras, and would then install the package
  with fewer dependencies, which could affect users that would have been relying
  on these. Therefore, changing dependencies from required to a default extra in
  an established package should only be done in future once the developers only
  want to support users with installers that implement this PEP.

* Making an existing extra become a default should be safer, such as making
  ``recommended`` in `astropy`_ be a default extra, but in order to support users
  with older versions of package installers, the documentation should still mention
  the extra explicitly as long as possible (until it is clear that most/all users
  are using package installers that implement this PEP). There is no downside to
  keeping the extra be explicitly mentioned, but this will ensure that users with
  modern tooling who do not read documentation (which may be a non-negligeable
  fraction of the user community) will start getting the recommended
  dependencies by default.

* Adding a new extra, whether it be ``minimal`` or another new extra that is to
  be the default, comes with the same caveats that it does prior to this PEP, which
  is that users will only be able to use this extra for releases that define
  this extra. This might seem obvious, but consider a package that has a version
  1.0 prior to using default extras. Suppose that package now defines
  ``minimal`` in 2.0, then downstream users and packages that want to depend on
  a minimal version of the package cannot declare the following dependency::

    packaage[minimal]>=1.0

  because ``package[minimal]==1.0`` does not exist (in practice, pip ignores
  unknown extras, so it might be possible to do this, but there is no guarantee
  that other tools won't error on an unrecognized extra).

  The easiest solution to this problem is for package authors to define a no-op
  ``minimal`` extra as soon as possible, even if only planning to adopt default
  extras further down the road, as it will allow ``package[minimal]`` to work
  for versions prior to when defaults were adopted.

Avoiding adding too many default dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

One temptation for authors might be to include many dependencies by default since
they can provide a way to opt out from these. We recommend however that authors
carefully consider what is included by default to avoid unecessarily bloating
installations and complicating dependency trees. Using default extras does not
mean that all extras need to be defaults, and there is still scope for users to
explicitly opt in to non-default extras.

Inheriting from default extras
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If package authors choose to make an extra be installed by default, it is important
that they are aware that if users explicitly specify another extra, the default may
not be installed, unless they use the approach described in `Supporting minimal
installations while not always removing default extras`_.

There are cases, such as the interchangeable backends, or the ``minimal`` extras,
where ignoring the default if an extra is explicitly specified is the right
thing to do. However, for other cases, such as using default extras to include
recommended dependencies while still providing a way to do minimal installs, it
may be that many of the other extras *should* explicitly 'inherit' the default
extra(s), so package authors should carefully consider in which cases they want
the default extras to be installed.

Incompatible extras
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In some cases, it may be that packages have extras that are mutually
incompatible. In this case, we recommend against making using the default extra
feature for any extra that contains a dependency that could be incompatible with
another.

Consider a package that has extras ``package[A]`` and ``package[B]``. Users
could already currently try and install ``package[A]`` and ``package[B]`` or
``package[A,B]`` which would result in a broken installation, however it would
at least be explicit that both extras were being installed. Making ``A`` into a
default extra however could lead to unintuitive issues. A user could do:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install package
    $ pip install package[B]

and end up with a broken installation, even though A and B were never explicitly
both installed. For this reason, we recommend against using default extras
for dependencies where this is likely to be an issue.

Package users
-------------

Package users should be provided with clear installation instructions that show
what extras are available for packages and how they behave, for example
explaining that by default some recommended dependencies or a given frontend or
backend will be installed, and how to opt out of this or override defaults,
depending what is available.

Repackagers of Python libraries
-------------------------------

The impact on individuals who repackage Python libraries for different
distributions, such as `conda <https://docs.conda.io>`_, `Homebrew
<https://brew.sh/>`_, linux package installers (such as ``apt`` and ``yum``) and
so on, needs to be considered. Not all package distributions have mechanisms
that would line up with the approach described. In fact, some distributions such
as conda, do not even have the concept of extras.

There are two cases to consider here:

* In cases where the repackaging is done by hand, such as for a number of conda-forge
  recipes, and especially where there is no equivalent to extras, the
  introduction of default extras should not have a large impact since manual
  decisions already have to be made as to which dependencies to include (for
  example, the conda-forge recipe for the `astropy`_ package mentioned in the
  `Motivation`_ includes all the ``recommended`` dependencies by default since
  there is no way for users to explicitly request them otherwise).

* In cases where the repackaging is done in an automated, way, distribution maintainers
  will need to carefully consider how to treat default extras, and this may
  imply a non-negligible amount of work and discussion.

It is impossible for a PEP such as this to exhaustively consider each of the
different package distributions. However, ultimately, default extras should be
understood as how package authors would like their package to be installed for
the majority of users, and this should inform decisions about how default extras
should be handled, whether manually or automatically.

Reference Implementation
========================

The following repository contains a fully functional demo package
that makes use of default extras:

https://github.com/wheel-next/pep_771

This makes use of modified branches of several packages, and the following
links are to these branches:

* `Setuptools <https://github.com/wheel-next/setuptools/tree/pep_771>`_
* `pip <https://github.com/wheel-next/pip/tree/pep_771>`_
* `importlib_metadata <https://github.com/wheel-next/importlib_metadata/tree/pep_771>`_

In addition, `this branch <https://github.com/astrofrog/flit/tree/default-extras-pep>`_
contains a modified version of the `Flit
<https://flit.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_ package.



The implementations above are proofs-of-concept at this time and the existing changes have
not yet been reviewed by the relevant maintainers. Nevertheless, they are
functional enough to allow for interested maintainers to try these out.

Rejected Ideas
==============

Syntax for deselecting extras
-----------------------------

One of the main competing approaches was as follows: instead of having defaults
be unselected if any extras were explicitly provided, default extras would need
to be explicitly unselected.

In this picture, a new syntax for unselecting extras would be introduced as an
extension of the mini-language defined in :pep:`508`. If a package defined
default extras, users could opt out of these defaults by using a minus sign
(``-``) before the extra name. The proposed syntax update would have been as follows::

    extras_list   = (-)?identifier (wsp* ',' wsp* (-)?identifier)*

Valid examples of this new syntax would have included, e.g.:

* ``package[-recommended]``
* ``package[-backend1, backend2]``
* ``package[pdf, -svg]``

However, there are two main issues with this approach:

* One would need to define a number of rules for how to interpret corner cases
  such as if an extra and its negated version were both present in the same
  dependency specification (e.g. ``package[pdf, -pdf]``) or if a dependency
  tree included both ``package[pdf]`` and ``package[-pdf]``, and the rules would
  not be intuitive to users.

* More critically, this would introduce new syntax into dependency specification,
  which means that if any package defined a dependency using the new syntax, it
  and any other package depending on it would no longer be installable by existing
  packaging tools, so this would be a major backward compatibility break.

For these reasons, this alternative was not included in the final proposal.

Adding a special entry in ``extras_require``
--------------------------------------------

A potential solution that has been explored as an alternative to introducing the
new ``Default-Extra`` metadata field would be to make use of an extra with a
'special' name.

One example would be to use an empty string::

    Provides-Extra:
    Requires-Dist: numpy ; extra == ''

The idea would be that dependencies installed as part of the 'empty' extras
would only get installed if another extra was not specified. An implementation
of this was proposed in https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/pull/1503, but it
was found that there would be no way to make this work without breaking
compatibility with existing usage. For example, packages using Setuptools via
a ``setup.py`` file can do::

    setup(
        ...
        extras_require={'': ['package_a']},
    )


which is valid and equivalent to having ``package_a`` being defined in
``install_requires``, so changing the meaning of the empty string would
break compatibility.

In addition, no other string (such as ``'default'``) can be used as a special
string since all strings that would be a backward-compatible valid extras name
may already be used in existing packages.

There have been suggestions of using the special ``None`` Python variable, but
again this is not possible, because even though one can use ``None`` in a ``setup.py`` file,
this is not possible in declarative files such as ``setup.cfg`` or
``pyproject.toml``, and furthermore ultimately extras names have to be converted
to strings in the package metadata. Having::

    Provides-Extra: None

would be indistinguishable from the string 'None' which may already be used as
an extra name in a Python package. If we were to modify the core metadata
syntax to allow non-string 'special' extras names, then we would be back to
modifying the core metadata specification, which is no better than
introducing ``Default-Extra``.

Relying on tooling to deselect any default extras
-------------------------------------------------

Another option to unselect extras would be to implement this at the
level of packaging tools. For instance, pip could include an option such as:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install package --no-default-extras

This option could apply to all or specific packages, similar to
the ``--no-binary`` option, e.g.,:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install package --no-default-extras :all:

The advantage of this approach is that tools supporting default extras could
also support unselecting them. This approach would be similar to the ``--no-install-recommends``
option for the ``apt`` tool.

However, this solution is not ideal because it would not allow packages to
specify themselves that they do not need some of the default extras of a
dependency. It would also carry risks for users who might disable all default
extras in a big dependency tree, potentially breaking packages in the tree that
rely on default extras at any point. Nevertheless, this PEP does not disallow
this approach and it is up to the maintainers of different packaging tools to
decide if they want to support this kind of option.

``package[]`` disables default extras
-------------------------------------

Another way to specify not to install any extras, including default extras, would
be to use ``package[]``. However, this would break the current assumption in packaging tools that
``package[]`` is equivalent to ``package``, and may also result
in developers overusing ``[]`` by default even when it is not needed. As
highlighted in `How to teach this`_, there may also be cases where package
maintainers do not actually want to support an installation without any extras,
for example in cases where at least one backend or frontend must be installed.

Open issues
===========

Should ``package[]`` disable default extras?
--------------------------------------------

Currently, the PEP as written above does not allow ``package[]`` to be
equivalent to installing the package with no extras, but there would be some
benefits to allowing this:

* It would avoid different packages using different names for a 'no default'
  extras (e.g. ``minimal``, ``no-default``, ``no-defaults``) and reduce the
  burden for people who don’t want to have to scan through source code or
  documentation to figure out whether there is the equivalent of a ``minimal``
  extra.

* It would allow people who want to use existing packages as-is and future
  versions of those packages with no default extras to use ``package[]`` because
  that syntax works right now, so it would provide a consistent way over time to
  get a minimal install.

On the other hand, it is not clear at this point whether any tools are currently
relying on ``package[]`` being identical to ``package`` in a way that would
break compatibility if this was done, so this needs to be investigated.
