Abstract
========

This PEP proposes a new module for number-theoretical, combinatorial and other
functions defined for integer arguments, like
:external+py3.14:func:`math.gcd` or :external+py3.14:func:`math.isqrt`.


Motivation
==========

The :external+py3.14:mod:`math` documentation says: "This module provides access
to the mathematical functions defined by the C standard."  But,
over time the module was populated with functions that aren't related to
the C standard or floating-point arithmetics.  Now it's much harder to describe
module scope, content and interfaces (returned values or accepted arguments).

For example, the :external+py3.14:mod:`math` module documentation says: "Except
when explicitly noted otherwise, all return values are floats."  This is no
longer true:  *None* of the functions listed in the `Number-theoretic
functions <https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/math.html#number-theoretic-functions>`_
subsection of the documentation return a float, but the
documentation doesn't say so.  In the documentation for the proposed ``imath`` module the sentence "All
return values are integers." would be accurate.  In a similar way we
can simplify the description of the accepted arguments for functions in both the
:external+py3.14:mod:`math` and the new module.

Apparently, the :external+py3.14:mod:`math` module can't serve as a catch-all place
for mathematical functions since we also have the :external+py3.14:mod:`cmath` and
:external+py3.14:mod:`statistics` modules.  Let's do the same for integer-related
functions.  It provides shared context, which reduces verbosity in the
documentation and conceptual load.  It also aids discoverability through
grouping related functions and makes IDE suggestions more helpful.

Currently the :external+py3.14:mod:`math` module code in the CPython is around
4200LOC, from which the new module code is roughly 1/3 (1300LOC).  This is
comparable with the :external+py3.14:mod:`cmath` (1340LOC), which is *not* a
simple wrapper to the ``libm``, as most functions in the
:external+py3.14:mod:`math` module.


Specification
=============

The PEP proposes moving the following integer-related functions to a new
module, called ``imath``:

* :external+py3.14:func:`~math.comb`
* :external+py3.14:func:`~math.factorial`
* :external+py3.14:func:`~math.gcd`
* :external+py3.14:func:`~math.isqrt`
* :external+py3.14:func:`~math.lcm`
* :external+py3.14:func:`~math.perm`

Their aliases in :external+py3.14:mod:`math` will be :term:`soft deprecated`.

Module functions will accept integers and objects that implement the
:external+py3.14:meth:`~object.__index__` method, which is used to convert the
object to an integer number.  Suitable functions must be computed exactly,
given sufficient time and memory.

Possible extensions for the new module and its scope are discussed in the
`Open Issues <Open Issues_>`_ section.  New functions are not part of this
proposal.


Backwards Compatibility
=======================

As aliases in :external+py3.14:mod:`math` will be kept for an indefinite time
(their use would be discouraged), there are no anticipated code breaks.


How to Teach This
=================

The new module will be a place for functions, that 1) accept
:external+py3.14:class:`int`-like arguments and also return integers, and 2) are
also in the field of arbitrary-precision integer arithmetic, i.e. have no
dependency on the platform floating-point format or behaviour and/or on the
platform math library (``libm``).

For users it would be natural first to look on the
:external+py3.14:class:`int`'s methods, which cover most basic use-cases (e.g.
:external+py3.14:meth:`int.bit_length` method), than to some dedicated place in
the stdlib.


Reference Implementation
========================

`python/cpython#133909 <https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/133909>`_


Open Issues
===========

Module name
-----------

The chosen name seems consistent with one existing domain-specific mathematical module:
:external+py3.14:mod:`cmath` (for complex numbers).

We note the `Imath
<https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/Imath>`_ C++ library includes
Python bindings with the same name.  There is also an :pypi:`imath` project on
PyPI, but only with two releases, with the most recent one four years ago.  Its
repository is no longer accessible.

`Polling showed <https://discuss.python.org/t/91337/35>`_ ``intmath`` as another
popular name.  The argument made was that the normal mathematical spelling of
the imaginary unit is ``i``, which makes ``imath`` ambiguous.  It also has no conflict
with any PyPI module.  On the other hand, ``intmath`` may be confused with
interval math or numerical integration.

Other proposed names include ``ntheory`` (like SymPy's submodule),
``integermath`` and ``imaths``.


Module scope and possible extensions
------------------------------------

Unless we can just provide bindings to some well supported mathematical library
like the GMP, the module scope should be limited.  For example, no primality
testing and factorization, as production-quality implementatons will require a
decent mathematical background from contributors and belongs rather to
specialized libraries.

Some possible additions, among those proposed in the initial discussion thread
(see also issue
`python/cpython#81313 <https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/81313>`_):

* ``ceil_div()`` --- for integer ceiling divide, see
  `relevant discussion thread <https://discuss.python.org/t/91269>`_.
* ``gcdext()`` --- to solve linear `Diophantine equation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diophantine_equation>`_ in two variables (the
  :external+py3.14:class:`int` implementation actually includes an extended
  Euclidean algorithm)
* ``isqrt_rem()`` --- to return both an integer square root and a remainder (which is non-zero only if
  the integer isn't a perfect square)
* ``ilog()`` --- integer logarithm, :external+py3.14:func:`math.log`
  has special handling for integer arguments.  It's unique (with respect to other module
  functions) and not documented so far, see issue
  `python/cpython#120950 <https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/120950>`_.
* ``fibonacci()`` --- `Fibonacci sequence <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence>`_.


Rejected ideas
==============

There was a brief discussion about exposing :external+py3.14:func:`math.isqrt`
as ``imath.sqrt`` in the same way that :external+py3.14:func:`cmath.sqrt` is
the complex version of :external+py3.14:func:`math.sqrt`.  However, ``isqrt``
is ultimately a different function: it is the floor of the square root.  It
would be confusing to give it the same name (under a different module).


Acknowledgements
================

Thanks to Tim Peters for reviving the idea of splitting the :external+py3.14:mod:`math`
module.  Thanks to Neil Girdhar for substantial improvements of
the initial draft.
