Abstract
========

This PEP proposes a new module for number-theoretical, combinatorial and other
functions defined for integer arguments, like
:external+py3.14:func:`math.gcd` or :external+py3.14:func:`math.isqrt`.


Motivation
==========

The :external+py3.14:mod:`math` documentation says: "This module provides access
to the mathematical functions defined by the C standard."  But,
over time the module was populated with functions that aren't related to
the C standard or floating-point arithmetics.  Now it's much harder to describe
module scope, content and interfaces (returned values or accepted arguments).

For example, the :external+py3.14:mod:`math` module documentation says: "Except
when explicitly noted otherwise, all return values are floats."  This is no
longer true:  *None* of the functions listed in the `Number-theoretic
functions <https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/math.html#number-theoretic-functions>`_
subsection of the documentation return a float, but the
documentation doesn't say so.  In the documentation for the proposed ``intmath`` module the sentence "All
return values are integers." would be accurate.  In a similar way we
can simplify the description of the accepted arguments for functions in both the
new module and in :external+py3.14:mod:`math`.

Apparently, the :external+py3.14:mod:`math` module can't serve as a catch-all place
for mathematical functions since we also have the :external+py3.14:mod:`cmath` and
:external+py3.14:mod:`statistics` modules.  Let's do the same for integer-related
functions.  It provides shared context, which reduces verbosity in the
documentation and conceptual load.  It also aids discoverability through
grouping related functions and makes IDE suggestions more helpful.

Currently the :external+py3.14:mod:`math` module code in the CPython is around
4200LOC, from which the new module code is roughly 1/3 (1300LOC).  This is
comparable with the :external+py3.14:mod:`cmath` (1340LOC), which is *not* a
simple wrapper to the ``libm``, as most functions in the
:external+py3.14:mod:`math` module.

And this situation tends to get worse.  When the module split `was first
proposed
<https://mail.python.org/archives/list/python-ideas@python.org/thread/YYJ5YJBJNCVXQWK5K3WSVNMPUSV56LOR/>`_,
there were only two integer-related functions:
:external+py3.14:func:`~math.factorial` and :external+py3.14:func:`~math.gcd`.
Now there are six and :external+py3.14:func:`~math.factorial` doesn't accept
:class:`float`'s anymore.

Some possible additions, among those proposed in the initial discussion thread
and issue
`python/cpython#81313 <https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/81313>`_ are:

* ``ceil_div()`` --- for integer ceiling divide, see
  `relevant discussion thread <https://discuss.python.org/t/91269>`_.
* ``gcdext()`` --- to solve linear `Diophantine equation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diophantine_equation>`_ in two variables (the
  :external+py3.14:class:`int` implementation actually includes an extended
  Euclidean algorithm)
* ``isqrt_rem()`` --- to return both an integer square root and a remainder (which is non-zero only if
  the integer isn't a perfect square)
* ``ilog()`` --- integer logarithm, :external+py3.14:func:`math.log`
  has special handling for integer arguments.  It's unique (with respect to other module
  functions) and not documented so far, see issue
  `python/cpython#120950 <https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/120950>`_.
* ``fibonacci()`` --- `Fibonacci sequence <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence>`_.


Rationale
=========

Why not fix the :external+py3.14:mod:`math` module documentation instead?
Sure, we can be much more vague in the module preamble (i.e. roughly say
that "the :external+py3.14:mod:`math` module contains some mathematical
functions"), we can accurately describe input/output for each function
and it's behavior (e.g. whether the :external+py3.14:func:`~math.factorial`
output is exact or not, like e.g. the `scipy.special.factorial <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.special.factorial.html#scipy.special.factorial>`_, per default).

But the major issue is that the current module mixes different, almost non-interlaced
application domains.  Adding more documentation will just highlight this and
make the issue worse for end users (more text to read/skip).  And it will not
fix issue with discoverability (to know in which module to find a function, and
that it can be found at all, you need to look at all the functions in the
module), nor with tab-completion.


Specification
=============

The PEP proposes moving the following integer-related functions to a new
module, called ``intmath``:

* :external+py3.14:func:`~math.comb`
* :external+py3.14:func:`~math.factorial`
* :external+py3.14:func:`~math.gcd`
* :external+py3.14:func:`~math.isqrt`
* :external+py3.14:func:`~math.lcm`
* :external+py3.14:func:`~math.perm`

Their aliases in :external+py3.14:mod:`math` will be :term:`soft deprecated`.

Module functions will accept integers and objects that implement the
:external+py3.14:meth:`~object.__index__` method, which is used to convert the
object to an integer number.  Suitable functions must be computed exactly,
given sufficient time and memory.

The :pypi:`intmath` package will provide new module for older Python versions.


Possible Extensions
===================

New functions (like mentioned in `Motivation <Motivation_>`_ section) are not
part of this proposal.

Though, we should mention that, unless we can just provide bindings to some
well supported mathematical library like the GMP, the module scope should be
limited.  For example, no primality testing and factorization, as
production-quality implementatons will require a decent mathematical background
from contributors and belongs rather to specialized libraries.

When proposed function already exists in the :pypi:`gmpy2`, we should prefer a
compatible interface for the stdlib.


Backwards Compatibility
=======================

As aliases in :external+py3.14:mod:`math` will be kept for an indefinite time
(their use would be discouraged), there are no anticipated code breaks.


How to Teach This
=================

The new module will be a place for functions, that 1) accept
:external+py3.14:class:`int`-like arguments and also return integers, and 2) are
also in the field of arbitrary-precision integer arithmetic, i.e. have no
dependency on the platform floating-point format or behaviour and/or on the
platform math library (``libm``).

For users it would be natural first to look on the
:external+py3.14:class:`int`'s methods, which cover most basic use-cases (e.g.
:external+py3.14:meth:`int.bit_length` method), than to some dedicated place in
the stdlib.


Reference Implementation
========================

`python/cpython#133909 <https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/133909>`_


Rejected ideas
==============

Module name
-----------

`Polling showed <https://discuss.python.org/t/92548/67>`_ ``intmath`` as most
popular candidate with ``imath`` as a second winner.

Other proposed names include ``ntheory`` (like SymPy's submodule),
``integermath``, ``zmath``, ``dmath`` and ``imaths``.

As a variant, the new module can be added as a submodule of the
:external+py3.14:mod:`math`: ``integer`` (most preferred), ``discrete``
or ``ntheory``.


isqrt() renaming
---------------------------------------------

There was a brief discussion about exposing :external+py3.14:func:`math.isqrt`
as ``imath.sqrt`` in the same way that :external+py3.14:func:`cmath.sqrt` is
the complex version of :external+py3.14:func:`math.sqrt`.  However, ``isqrt``
is ultimately a different function: it is the floor of the square root.  It
would be confusing to give it the same name (under a different module).
