Abstract
========

This PEP proposes an extensible API for uploading files to a Python package index such as PyPI.
Along with standardization, the upload API provides additional useful features such as support for:

* a publishing session, which can be used to simultaneously publish
  all wheels in a package release;

* "staging" a release, which can be used to test uploads before publicly publishing them,
  without the need for `test.pypi.org <https://test.pypi.org/>`__;

* artifacts which can be overwritten and replaced, until a session is published;

* detailed status on the state of artifact uploads;

* new project creation without requiring the uploading of an artifact.

* a protocol to extend the supported upload mechanisms in the future without requiring a full PEP;
  these can be standardized and recommended for all indexes, or be index-specific;

Once this new upload API is adopted, the existing legacy API can be deprecated, however this PEP
does not propose a deprecation schedule for the legacy API.


Rationale
=========

There is currently no standardized API for uploading files to a Python package index such as
PyPI. Instead, everyone has been forced to reverse engineer the existing `"legacy"
<https://docs.pypi.org/api/upload/>`__ API.

The legacy API, while functional, leaks implementation details of the original PyPI code base,
which has been faithfully replicated in the new code base and alternative implementations.

In addition, there are a number of major issues with the legacy API:

* It is fully synchronous, which forces requests to be held open both for the upload itself, and
  while the index processes the uploaded file to determine success or failure.

* It does not support any mechanism for parallelizing or resuming an upload. With the largest
  default file size on PyPI being around 1GB in size, requiring the entire upload to complete
  successfully means bandwidth is wasted when such uploads experience a network interruption while
  the request is in progress.

* The atomic unit of operation is a single file.  This is problematic when a release logically
  includes an sdist and multiple binary wheels, leading to race conditions where consumers get
  different versions of the package if they are unlucky enough to require a package before their
  platform's wheel has completely uploaded. If the release uploads its sdist first, this may also
  manifest in some consumers seeing only the sdist, triggering a local build from source.

* Status reporting is very limited.  There's no support for reporting multiple errors, warnings,
  deprecations, etc.  Status is limited to the HTTP status code and reason phrase, of which the
  reason phrase has been deprecated since HTTP/2 (:rfc:`RFC 7540 <7540#section-8.1.2.4>`).

* Metadata for a release is submitted alongside the file. However, as this metadata is famously
  unreliable, most installers instead choose to download the entire file and read the metadata from
  there.

* There is no mechanism for allowing an index to do any sort of sanity checks before bandwidth gets
  expended on an upload.  Many cases of invalid metadata or incorrect permissions could be checked
  prior to uploading files.

* There is no support for "staging" a release prior to publishing it to the index.

* Creation of new projects requires the uploading of at least one file, leading to "stub" uploads
  to claim a project namespace.

The new upload API proposed in this PEP provides ways to solve all of these problems,
either directly or through an extensible approach,
allowing servers to implement features such as resumable and parallel uploads.
This upload API this PEP proposes provides
better error reporting,
a more robust release testing experience,
and atomic and simultaneous publishing of all release artifacts.

Legacy API
==========

The following is an overview of the legacy API.  For the detailed description, consult the
`PyPI user guide documentation <https://docs.pypi.org/api/upload/>`__.


Endpoint
--------

The existing upload API lives at a base URL.  For PyPI, that URL is currently
``https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/``.  Clients performing uploads specify the API they want to call
by adding an ``:action`` URL parameter with a value of ``file_upload``. [#fn-action]_

The legacy API also has a ``protocol_version`` parameter,
in theory allowing new versions of the API to be defined.
In practice this has never happened, and the value is always ``1``.

Thus, the effective upload API on PyPI is:
``https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/?:action=file_upload&protocol_version=1``.


Encoding
--------

The data to be submitted is submitted as a ``POST`` request with the content type of
``multipart/form-data``.  This reflects the legacy API's historical nature, which was originally
designed not as an API, but rather as a web form on the initial PyPI implementation,
with client code written to programmatically submit that form.


Content
-------

Roughly speaking, the metadata contained within the package is submitted as parts where the content
disposition is ``form-data``, and the metadata key is the name of the field. The names of these
various pieces of metadata are not documented, and they sometimes, but not always match the names
used in the ``METADATA`` files for package artifacts.
The case rarely matches, and the ``form-data`` to ``METADATA`` conversion is inconsistent.

The upload artifact file itself is sent as a ``application/octet-stream`` part with the name of
``content``, and if there is a PGP signature attached, then it will be included as a
``application/octet-stream`` part with the name of ``gpg_signature``.


Authentication
--------------

Upload authentication is also not standardized.

PyPI uses HTTP Basic Authentication
with `API tokens <https://pypi.org/help/#apitoken>`__ as the password
and the username ``__token__``.
`Trusted Publishers <https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/>`__
authenticate via OpenID Connect and receive short-lived API tokens
that are used in the same way.

.. _spec:

Upload 2.0 API Specification
============================

This PEP traces the root cause of most of the issues with the existing API to be roughly two things:

- The metadata is submitted alongside the file, rather than being parsed from the
  file itself. [#fn-metadata]_

- It supports only a single request, using only form data, that either succeeds or fails, and all
  actions are atomic within that single request.

To address these issues, this PEP proposes a multi-request workflow, which at a high level involves
these steps:

#. Initiate an :ref:`Publishing Session <publishing-session>`, creating a release stage.
#. Initiate :ref:`File Upload Session(s) <file-upload-session>` to that stage
   as part of the Publishing Session.
#. Negotiate the specific :ref:`File Upload Mechanism <file-upload-mechanisms>` to use
   between client and server.
#. Execute File Upload Mechanism for the File Upload Session(s) using the negotiated mechanism(s).
#. Complete the File Upload Session(s), marking them as completed or canceled.
#. Complete the Publishing Session, publishing or discarding the stage.
#. Optionally check the status of a Publishing Session.

.. _versioning:

Versioning
----------

This PEP uses the same ``MAJOR.MINOR`` versioning system as used in :pep:`691`,
but it is otherwise independently versioned.
The legacy API is considered by this PEP to be version ``1.0``,
but this PEP does not modify the legacy API in any way.

The API proposed in this PEP therefore has the version number ``2.0``.

Both major and minor version numbers of the Upload API
**MUST** only be changed through the PEP process.
Index operators and implementers **MUST NOT** advertise or implement
new API versions without an approved PEP.
This ensures consistency across all implementations
and prevents fragmentation of the ecosystem.

Content Types
-------------

Like :pep:`691`, this PEP proposes that all requests and responses from this upload API will have a
standard content type that describes what the content is, what version of the API it represents,
and what serialization format has been used.

This standard request content type applies to all requests *except* for requests to execute
a File Upload Mechanism, which will be specified by the documentation for that mechanism.

The structure of the ``Content-Type`` header for all other requests is:

.. code-block:: text

    application/vnd.pypi.upload.$version+$format

Since minor API version differences should never be disruptive, only the major version is included
in the content type; the version number is prefixed with a ``v``.

The major API version specified in the ``.meta.api-version`` JSON key of client requests
**MUST** match the ``Content-Type`` header for major version.

Unlike :pep:`691`, this PEP does not change the existing *legacy* ``1.0`` upload API in any way,
so servers are required to host the new API described in this PEP at a different endpoint than the
existing upload API.

Since JSON is the only defined request format defined in this PEP, all non-file-upload requests
defined in this PEP **MUST** include a ``Content-Type`` header value of:

- ``application/vnd.pypi.upload.v2+json``.

Similar to :pep:`691`, this PEP also standardizes on using server-driven content negotiation to
allow clients to request different versions or serialization formats,
which includes the ``format`` part of the content type.
However, since this PEP expects the existing legacy ``1.0`` upload API
to exist at a different endpoint,
and this PEP currently only provides for JSON serialization,
this mechanism is not particularly useful.
Clients only have a single version and serialization they can request.
However clients **SHOULD** be prepared to handle content negotiation gracefully
in the case that additional formats or versions are added in the future.

Servers **MUST NOT** advertise support for API versions beyond those defined in approved PEPs.
Any new versions or formats require standardization through a new PEP.

Unless otherwise specified, all HTTP requests and responses in this document are assumed to include
the HTTP header:

.. code-block:: text

    Content-Type: application/vnd.pypi.upload.v2+json


Root Endpoint
-------------

All URLs described here are relative to the "root endpoint", which may be located anywhere within
the url structure of a domain. For example, the root endpoint could be
``https://upload.example.com/``, or ``https://example.com/upload/``.

The choice of the root endpoint is left up to the index operator.


Authentication for Upload 2.0 API
----------------------------------

All endpoints in this specification **MUST** use standard HTTP authentication
mechanisms as defined in :rfc:`7235`.

Authentication follows the standard HTTP pattern:

- Servers use the ``WWW-Authenticate`` response header when authentication is required
- Clients provide credentials via the ``Authorization`` request header
- ``401 Unauthorized`` indicates missing or invalid authentication
- ``403 Forbidden`` indicates insufficient permissions

The specific authentication schemes (e.g., Bearer, Basic, Digest)
are determined by the index operator.


.. _session-errors:

Errors
------

All error responses that contain content look like:

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "meta": {
        "api-version": "2.0"
      },
      "message": "...",
      "errors": [
        {
          "source": "...",
          "message": "..."
        }
      ]
    }

Besides the standard ``meta`` key, this has the following top level keys:

``message``
    A singular message that encapsulates all errors that may have happened on this
    request.

``errors``
    An array of specific errors, each of which contains a ``source`` key, which is a string that
    indicates what the source of the error is, and a ``message`` key for that specific error.

The ``message`` and ``source`` strings do not have any specific meaning, and are intended for human
interpretation to aid in diagnosing underlying issue.


.. _publishing-session:

Publishing Session
------------------

.. _publishing-session-create:

Create a Publishing Session
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A release starts by creating a new Publishing Session.  To create the session, a client submits a
``POST`` request to the root URL like:

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "meta": {
        "api-version": "2.0"
      },
      "name": "foo",
      "version": "1.0",
      "nonce": "<string>"
    }


The request includes the following top-level keys:

``meta`` (**required**)
    Describes information about the payload itself.  Currently, the only defined sub-key is
    ``api-version`` the value of which must be the string ``"2.0"``.

``name`` (**required**)
    The name of the project that this session is attempting to release a new version of.

``version`` (**required**)
    The version of the project that this session is attempting to add files to.

``nonce`` (**optional**)
    An additional client-side string input to the
    :ref:`"Publishing Session Token" <publishing-session-token>` algorithm.
    Details are provided below, but if this key is omitted,
    it is equivalent to passing the empty string.

Upon successful session creation, the server returns a ``201 Created`` response.  If an error
occurs, the appropriate ``4xx`` code will be returned, as described in the :ref:`session-errors`
section.

If a session is created for a project which has no previous release,
then the index **MAY** reserve the project name before the session is published,
however it **MUST NOT** be possible to navigate to that project using
the "regular" (i.e. :ref:`unstaged <staged-preview>`) access protocols,
*until* the stage is published.
If this first-release stage gets canceled,
then the index **SHOULD** delete the project record, as if it were never uploaded.

The session is owned by the user that created it,
and all subsequent requests **MUST** be performed with the same credentials,
otherwise a ``403 Forbidden`` will be returned on those subsequent requests.


.. _publishing-session-response:

Response Body
+++++++++++++

The successful response includes the following content:

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "meta": {
        "api-version": "2.0"
      },
      "links": {
        "stage": "...",
        "upload": "...",
        "session": "...",
      },
      "mechanisms": ["http-post-bytes"],
      "session-token": "<token-string>",
      "expires-at": "2025-08-01T12:00:00Z",
      "status": "pending",
      "files": {},
      "notices": [
        "a notice to display to the user"
      ]
    }


Besides the ``meta`` key, which has the same format as the request JSON, the success response has
the following keys:

``links``
    A dictionary mapping :ref:`keys to URLs <publishing-session-links>` related to this session,
    the details of which are provided below.

``mechanisms``
    A list of file-upload mechanisms supported by the server, sorted in server-preferred order.
    At least one value is required.

``session-token``
    If the index supports :ref:`previewing staged releases <staged-preview>`,
    this key will contain the unique :ref:`"session token" <publishing-session-token>`
    that can be provided to installers in order to preview the staged release before it's published.
    If the index does *not* support stage previewing, this key **MUST** be omitted.

``expires-at``
    An ISO8601 formatted timestamp string representing when the server will expire this session,
    and thus all of its content, including any uploaded files and the URL links related to the
    session. The session **SHOULD** remain active until at least this time
    unless the client itself has canceled or published the session. Servers **MAY** choose to
    extend this expiration time, but should never move it earlier.
    Clients can query the :ref:`session status <session-status>`
    to get the current expiration time of the session.

``status``
    A string that contains one of ``pending``, ``published``, ``error``, or ``canceled``,
    representing the overall :ref:`status of the session <session-status>`.

``files``
    A mapping containing the filenames that have been uploaded to this session, to a mapping
    containing details about each :ref:`file referenced in this session <publishing-session-files>`.

``notices``
    An optional key that points to an array of human-readable informational notices that the server
    wishes to communicate to the end user.  These notices are specific to the overall session, not
    to any particular file in the session.


.. _publishing-session-links:

Publishing Session Links
++++++++++++++++++++++++

For the ``links`` key in the success JSON, the following sub-keys are valid:

``upload``
    The endpoint session clients will use to initiate a :ref:`File Upload Session <file-upload-session>`
    for each file to be included in this session.

``stage``
    The endpoint where this staged release can be :ref:`previewed <staged-preview>` prior to
    publishing the session.  This can be used to download and verify the not-yet-public files.  If
    the index does not support previewing staged releases, this key **MUST** be omitted.

``session``
    The endpoint where actions for this session can be performed,
    including :ref:`publishing this session <publishing-session-completion>`,
    :ref:`canceling and discarding the session <publishing-session-cancellation>`,
    :ref:`querying the current session status <session-status>`,
    and :ref:`requesting an extension of the session lifetime <session-extension>`
    (*if* the server supports it).


.. _publishing-session-files:

Publishing Session Files
++++++++++++++++++++++++

The ``files`` key contains a mapping from the names of the files uploaded in this session to a
sub-mapping with the following keys:

``status``
    A string with valid values
    ``pending``, ``processing``, ``complete``, ``error``, and ``canceled``.
    If there was an error during upload,
    then clients should not assume the file is in any usable state,
    ``error`` will be returned and it's best to
    :ref:`cancel or delete <file-upload-session-cancelation>` the file and start over.
    This action would remove the file name from the ``files`` key of the
    :ref:`session status response body <publishing-session-response>`.

``link``
    The *absolute* URL that the client should use to reference this specific file.
    This URL is used to retrieve, replace, or delete
    the :ref:`referenced file <file-upload-session>`.
    If a ``nonce`` was provided, this URL **MUST** be obfuscated
    with a non-guessable token as described in the
    :ref:`Publishing Session Token <publishing-session-token>` section.

``notices``
    An optional key with similar format and semantics as the ``notices`` session key, except that
    these notices are specific to the referenced file.

If a second session is created for the same name-version pair while a session for that pair is in
the ``pending`` state, then the server **MUST** return the JSON status response for the already
existing session, along with the ``200 OK`` status code rather than creating a new, empty session.


.. _publishing-session-completion:

Complete a Publishing Session
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To complete a session and publish the files that have been included in it, a client issues a
``POST`` request to the ``session`` :ref:`link <publishing-session-links>`
given in the :ref:`session creation response body <publishing-session-response>`.

The request looks like:

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "meta": {
        "api-version": "2.0"
      },
      "action": "publish",
    }


If the server is able to immediately complete the Publishing Session, it may do so and return a
``201 Created`` response. If it is unable to immediately complete the Publishing Session
(for instance, if it needs to do validation that may take longer than reasonable in a single HTTP
request), then it may return a ``202 Accepted`` response.

In either case, the server should include a ``Location`` header pointing back to
the Publishing Session status URL,
and if the server returned a ``202 Accepted``,
the client may poll that URL to watch for the status to change.

If an error occurs, the appropriate ``4xx`` code should be returned, as described in the
:ref:`session-errors` section.

.. _publishing-session-cancellation:

Cancellation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To cancel a Publishing Session, a client issues a ``DELETE`` request to
the ``session`` :ref:`link <publishing-session-links>`
given in the :ref:`session creation response body <publishing-session-response>`.
The server then marks the session as canceled, and **SHOULD** purge any data that was uploaded
as part of that session.
Future attempts to access that session URL or any of the Publishing Session URLs
**MUST** return a ``404 Not Found``.

To prevent dangling sessions, servers may also choose to cancel timed-out sessions on their own
accord. It is recommended that servers expunge their sessions after no less than a week, but each
server may choose their own schedule.  Servers **MAY** support client-directed :ref:`session
extensions <session-extension>`.


.. _publishing-session-token:

Publishing Session Token
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When creating a Publishing Session, clients can provide a ``nonce`` in the
:ref:`initial session creation request <publishing-session-create>`.
This nonce is a string with arbitrary content.  The ``nonce`` is
optional, and if omitted, is equivalent to providing an empty string.

In order to support previewing of staged uploads, the package ``name`` and ``version``, along with
this ``nonce`` are used as input into a hashing algorithm to produce a unique "session token".
This session token is valid for the life of the session
(i.e., until it is completed, either by cancellation or publishing),
and can be provided to supporting installers to gain access to the staged release.

The use of the ``nonce`` allows clients to decide whether they want to
obscure the visibility of their staged releases or not,
and there can be good reasons for either choice.
For example, if a CI system wants to upload some wheels for a new release,
and wants to allow independent validation of a stage before it's published,
the client may opt for not including a nonce.
On the other hand, if a client would like to pre-seed a release which it publishes atomically
at the time of a public announcement,
that client will likely opt for providing a nonce.

The `SHA256 algorithm <https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html#hashlib.sha256>`_ is used to
turn these inputs into a unique token, in the order ``name``, ``version``, ``nonce``, using the
following Python code as an example:

.. code-block:: python

    from hashlib import sha256

    def gentoken(name: bytes, version: bytes, nonce: bytes = b''):
        h = sha256()
        h.update(name)
        h.update(version)
        h.update(nonce)
        return h.hexdigest()

It should be evident that if no ``nonce`` is provided in the
:ref:`session creation request <publishing-session-create>`,
then the session token is easily guessable from the package name and version number alone.
Clients can elect to omit the ``nonce`` (or set it to the empty string themselves)
if they want to allow previewing from anybody without access to the session token.
By providing a non-empty ``nonce``,
clients can elect for security-through-obscurity,
but this does not protect staged files behind any kind of authentication.


File Upload Session
-------------------

.. _file-upload-session:

Create a File Upload Session
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After creating a Publishing Session, the ``upload`` endpoint from the response's
:ref:`session links <publishing-session-links>` mapping
is used to begin the upload of new files into that session.
Clients **MUST** use the provided ``upload`` URL and
**MUST NOT** assume there is any pattern or commonality to those URLs from one session to the next.

To initiate a file upload, a client first sends a ``POST`` request to the ``upload`` URL.
The request looks like:

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "meta": {
        "api-version": "2.0"
      },
      "filename": "foo-1.0.tar.gz",
      "size": 1000,
      "hashes": {"sha256": "...", "blake2b": "..."},
      "metadata": "...",
      "mechanism": "http-post-bytes"
    }


Besides the standard ``meta`` key, the request JSON has the following additional keys:

``filename`` (**required**)
    The name of the file being uploaded.

``size`` (**required**)
    The size in bytes of the file being uploaded.

``hashes`` (**required**)
    A mapping of hash names to hex-encoded digests.  Each of these digests are the checksums of the
    file being uploaded when hashed by the algorithm identified in the name.

    By default, any hash algorithm available in `hashlib
    <https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html>`_ can be used as a key for the hashes
    dictionary [#fn-hash]_. At least one secure algorithm from ``hashlib.algorithms_guaranteed``
    **MUST** always be included. This PEP specifically recommends ``sha256``.

    Multiple hashes may be passed at a time, but all hashes provided **MUST** be valid for the file.

``mechanism`` (**required**)
    The file-upload mechanisms the client intends to use for this file.
    This mechanism **SHOULD** be chosen from the list of mechanisms advertised in the
    :ref:`Publishing Session response body <publishing-session-response>`.
    A client **MAY** send a mechanism that is not advertised in cases where server operators have
    documented a new or upcoming mechanism that is available for use on a "pre-release" basis.

``metadata`` (**optional**)
    If given, this is a string value containing the file's `core metadata
    <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/core-metadata/>`_.

Servers **MAY** use the data provided in this request to do some sanity checking prior to allowing
the file to be uploaded.  These checks may include, but are not limited to:

- checking if the ``filename`` already exists in a published release;

- checking if the ``size`` would exceed any project or file quota;

- checking if the contents of the ``metadata``, if provided, are valid.

If the server determines that upload should proceed, it will return a ``202 Accepted`` response,
with the response body below.
The :ref:`status <session-status>` of the session will also include
the filename in the ``files`` mapping.
If the server cannot proceed with an upload because
the ``mechanism`` supplied by the client is not supported
it **MUST** return a ``422 Unprocessable Entity``.
If the server determines the upload cannot proceed,
it **MUST** return a ``409 Conflict``.
The server **MAY** allow parallel uploads of files, but is not required to.

.. _file-upload-session-response:

Response Body
+++++++++++++

The successful response includes the following:

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "meta": {
        "api-version": "2.0"
      },
      "links": {
        "publishing-session": "...",
        "file-upload-session": "..."
      },
      "status": "pending",
      "expires-at": "2025-08-01T13:00:00Z",
      "mechanism": {
        "identifier": "http-post-bytes",
        "file_url": "...",
        "attestations_url": "..."
      }
    }

A ``Retry-After`` response header **MUST** be present
to indicate to clients when they should next poll for an updated status.

Besides the ``meta`` key, which has the same format as the request JSON, the success response has
the following keys:

``links``
    A dictionary mapping :ref:`keys to URLs <file-upload-session-links>` related to this session,
    the details of which are provided below.

``status``
    A string with valid values ``pending``, ``processing``, ``complete``, ``error``, and ``canceled``
    indicating the current state of the File Upload Session.

``expires-at``
    An ISO8601 formatted timestamp string representing when the server will expire this File Upload Session.
    The session **SHOULD** remain active until at least this time
    unless the client cancels or completes it. Servers **MAY** choose to
    extend this expiration time, but should never move it earlier.

``mechanism``
    A mapping containing the necessary details for the supported mechanism
    as negotiated by the client and server.
    This mapping **MUST** contain a key ``identifier`` which maps to
    the identifier string for the chosen File Upload Mechanism.

.. _file-upload-session-links:

File Upload Session Links
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

For the ``links`` key in the success JSON, the following sub-keys are valid:

``publishing-session``
    The endpoint where actions for the parent Publishing Session can be performed.

``file-upload-session``
    The endpoint where actions for this file-upload-session can be performed.
    including :ref:`canceling and discarding the File Upload Session <file-upload-session-cancelation>`,
    :ref:`querying the current File Upload Session status <session-status>`,
    and :ref:`requesting an extension of the File Upload Session lifetime <session-extension>`
    (*if* the server supports it).

.. _file-upload-session-completion:

Complete a File Upload Session
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To complete a File Upload Session, which indicates that the file upload mechanism has been executed
and did not produce an error, a client issues a ``POST`` to the ``file-upload-session`` link in the
File Upload Session creation response body.

The requests looks like:

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "meta": {
        "api-version": "2.0"
      },
      "action": "complete",
    }

If the server is able to immediately complete the File Upload Session, it may do so and return a
``201 Created`` response and set the status of the File Upload Session to ``complete``.
If it is unable to immediately complete the File Upload Session
(for instance, if it needs to do validation that may take longer than reasonable in a single HTTP
request), then it may return a ``202 Accepted`` response
and set the status of the File Upload Session to ``processing``.

In either case, the server should include a ``Location`` header pointing back to the File Upload
Session status URL.

Servers **MUST** allow clients to poll the File Upload Session status URL
to watch for the status to change.
If the server responds with a ``202 Accepted``,
clients may poll the File Upload Session status URL to watch for the status to change.
Clients **SHOULD** respect the ``Retry-After`` header value
of the File Upload Session status response.

If an error occurs, the appropriate ``4xx`` code should be returned, as described in the
:ref:`session-errors` section.


.. _file-upload-session-cancelation:

Cancellation and Deletion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A client can cancel an in-progress File Upload Session, or delete a file that has been
completely uploaded.  In both cases, the client performs this by issuing a ``DELETE`` request to
the File Upload Session URL of the file they want to delete.

A successful deletion request **MUST** respond with a ``204 No Content``.

Once canceled or deleted, a client **MUST NOT** assume that
the previous File Upload Session resource
or associated file upload mechanisms
can be reused.


Replacing a Partially or Fully Uploaded File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To replace a session file, the file upload **MUST** have been previously completed, canceled, or
deleted.  It is not possible to replace a file if the upload for that file is in-progress.

To replace a session file, clients should
:ref:`cancel and delete the in-progress upload <file-upload-session-cancelation>` by
issuing a ``DELETE`` to the upload resource URL for the file they want to replace.
After this, the new file upload can be initiated by beginning
the entire :ref:`file upload <file-upload-session>` sequence over again.
This means providing the metadata request again to retrieve a new upload resource URL.
Clients **MUST NOT** assume that the previous upload resource URL can be reused after deletion.


.. _session-status:

Session Status
--------------

At any time, a client can query the status of a session by issuing a ``GET`` request to the
``publishing-session`` :ref:`link <publishing-session-links>`
or ``file-upload-session`` :ref:`link <file-upload-session-links>`
given in the :ref:`session creation response body <publishing-session-response>`
or :ref:`File Upload Session creation response body <file-upload-session-response>`,
respectively.

The server will respond to this ``GET`` request with the same
:ref:`Publishing Session creation response body <publishing-session-response>`
or :ref:`File Upload Session creation response body <file-upload-session-response>`,
that they got when they initially created the Publishing Session or File Upload Session,
except with any changes to ``status``, ``expires-at``, or ``files`` reflected.


.. _session-extension:

Session Extension
-----------------

Servers **MAY** allow clients to extend sessions, but the overall lifetime and number of extensions
allowed is left to the server.  To extend a session, a client issues a ``POST`` request to the
``publishing-session`` :ref:`link <publishing-session-links>`
or ``file-upload-session`` :ref:`link <file-upload-session-links>`
given in the :ref:`Publishing Session creation response body <publishing-session-response>`
or :ref:`File Upload Session creation response body <file-upload-session-response>`,
respectively.

The request looks like:

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "meta": {
        "api-version": "2.0"
      },
      "action": "extend",
      "extend-for": 3600
    }

The number of seconds specified is just a suggestion to the server for the number of additional
seconds to extend the current session.  For example, if the client wants to extend the current
session for another hour, ``extend-for`` would be ``3600``.  Upon successful extension, the server
will respond with the same
:ref:`Publishing Session creation response body <publishing-session-response>`
or :ref:`File Upload Session creation response body <file-upload-session-response>`,
that they got when they initially created the Publishing Session or File Upload Session,
except with any changes to ``status``, ``expires-at``, or ``files`` reflected.

If the server refuses to extend the session for the requested number of seconds, it still returns a
success response, and the ``expires-at`` key will simply reflect the current expiration time of
the session.

.. _staged-preview:

Stage Previews
--------------

The ability to preview staged releases before they are published is an important feature of this
PEP, enabling an additional level of last-mile testing before the release is available to the
public.  Indexes **MAY** provide this functionality through the URL provided in the ``stage``
sub-key of the :ref:`links key <publishing-session-links>` returned when
the Publishing Session is created.
The ``stage`` URL can be passed to installers such as ``pip`` by setting the `--extra-index-url
<https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_install/#cmdoption-extra-index-url>`__ flag to this value.
Multiple stages can even be previewed by repeating this flag with multiple values.

If supported, the index will return views that expose the staged releases to the installer tool,
making them available to download and install into virtual environments built for that last-mile
testing.  This option allows existing installers to preview staged releases with no
changes to the installer tool required.
The details of this user experience are left to installer tool maintainers.


.. _file-upload-mechanisms:

File Upload Mechanisms
----------------------

Servers **MUST** implement :ref:`required file upload mechanisms <required-file-upload-mechanisms>`.
Such mechanisms serve as a fallback if no server specific implementations exist.

Each major version of the Upload API **MUST** specify at least one required File Upload Mechanism.

New required mechanisms **MUST NOT** be added
and existing required mechanisms **MUST NOT** be removed
without an update to the :ref:`major version <versioning>`.
Any server-specific or experimental mechanisms added or removed
**MUST NOT** change the major or minor version number of this specification.

.. _required-file-upload-mechanisms:

Required File Upload Mechanisms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``http-post-bytes``
+++++++++++++++++++

Upload API version 2.0 compliant servers **MUST** support the ``http-post-bytes`` mechanism.

This mechanism **MUST** use the same authentication scheme as
the rest of the Upload 2.0 protocol endpoints.

A client executes this mechanism by submitting a ``POST`` request to the ``file_url``
returned in the ``http-post-bytes`` map of the ``mechanism`` map of the
:ref:`File Upload Session creation response body <file-upload-session-response>` like:

.. code-block:: text

    Content-Type: application/octet-stream

    <binary contents of the file to upload>

Servers **MAY** support uploading of digital attestations for files (see :pep:`740`).
This support will be indicated by inclusion of an ``attestations_url`` key in the
``http-post-bytes`` map of the ``mechanism`` map of the
:ref:`File Upload Session creation response body <file-upload-session-response>`.
Attestations **MUST** be uploaded to the ``attestations_url`` before
:ref:`File Upload Session completion <file-upload-session-completion>`.

To upload an attestation, a client submits a ``POST`` request to the ``attestations_url``
containing a JSON array of :pep:`attestation objects <740#attestation-objects>` like:

.. code-block:: text

    Content-Type: application/json

    [{"version": 1, "verification_material": {...}, "envelope": {...}},...]


.. _server-specific-file-upload-mechanisms:

Server Specific File Upload Mechanisms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A given server **MAY** implement an arbitrary number of server specific mechanisms
and is responsible for documenting their usage.

A server specific implementation file upload mechanism identifier has three parts:

.. code-block:: text

    <prefix>-<operator identifier>-<implementation identifier>

Server specific implementations **MUST** use ``vnd`` as their ``prefix``.
The ``operator identifier`` **SHOULD** clearly identify the server operator,
be unique from other well known indexes,
and contain only alphanumeric characters ``[a-z0-9]``.
The ``implementation identifier`` **SHOULD** concisely describe the underlying implementation
and contain only alphanumeric characters ``[a-z0-9]`` and ``-``.

When server operators need to make breaking changes to their upload mechanisms,
they **SHOULD** create a new mechanism identifier rather than modifying the existing one.
The recommended pattern is to append a version suffix like ``-v1``, ``-v2``, etc.
to the implementation identifier.
This allows clients to explicitly opt into new versions while maintaining
backward compatibility with existing clients.

For example:

====================================== ================  =========================================================================
File Upload Mechanism string           Server Operator   Mechanism description
====================================== ================  =========================================================================
``vnd-pypi-s3multipart-presigned``     PyPI              S3 multipart upload via pre-signed URL
``vnd-pypi-s3multipart-presigned-v2``  PyPI              S3 multipart upload via pre-signed URL version 2
``vnd-pypi-http-fetch``                PyPI              File delivered by instructing server to fetch from a URL via HTTP request
``vnd-acmecorp-http-fetch``            Acme Corp         File delivered by instructing server to fetch from a URL via HTTP request
``vnd-acmecorp-postal``                Acme Corp         File delivered via postal mail
``vnd-widgetinc-stream-v1``            Widget Inc.       Streaming upload protocol version 1
``vnd-widgetinc-stream-v2``            Widget Inc.       Streaming upload protocol version 2
``vnd-madscience-quantumentanglement`` Mad Science Labs  Upload via quantum entanglement
====================================== ================  =========================================================================

If a server intends to precisely match the behavior of another server's implementation, it **MAY** respond
with that implementation's file upload mechanism name.


FAQ
===

Does this mean PyPI is planning to drop support for the existing upload API?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

At this time PyPI does not have any specific plans to drop support for the existing upload API.

Unlike with :pep:`691` there are significant benefits to doing so, so it is likely that support for
the legacy upload API to be (responsibly) deprecated and removed at some point in the future.
Such future deprecation planning is explicitly out of scope for *this* PEP.


Can I use the upload 2.0 API to reserve a project name?
-------------------------------------------------------

Yes!  If you're not ready to upload files to make a release, you can still reserve a project
name (assuming of course that the name doesn't already exist).

To do this,
:ref:`create a new Publishing Session <publishing-session-create>`,
then :ref:`publish the session <publishing-session-completion>` without uploading any files.
While the ``version`` key is required in the JSON body of the create session request,
you can simply use the placeholder version number ``"0.0.0"``.

The user that created the session will become the owner of the new project.


Open Questions
==============

Extensions to the Upload 2.0 Protocol
-------------------------------------

Features such as asynchronous webhook notifications for completion of upload processing
were discussed during review of this PEP.
The concept of a capabilities extension for the upload protocol was discussed,
which would allow implementers to advertise support for optional features
such as asynchronous notifications or webhooks.

This idea was left open due to the complexity that would arise in designing
such an extension protocol and ensuring that it did not cause excessive
fracturing of the ecosystem as Upload 2.0 is rolled out.

Future revisions to the upload protocol should explore such extensions
as experience is gained operating Upload 2.0.


.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#fn-action] Obsolete ``:action`` values ``submit``, ``submit_pkg_info``, and ``doc_upload`` are
                no longer supported


.. [#fn-metadata] This would be fine if used as a pre-check, but the parallel metadata should be
                  validated against the actual ``METADATA`` or similar files within the
                  distribution.

.. [#fn-hash] Specifically any hash algorithm name that `can be passed to
              <https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html#hashlib.new>`_ ``hashlib.new()`` and
              which does not require additional parameters.

.. [#fn-immutable] Published files may still be yanked (i.e. :pep:`592`) or `deleted
                   <https://pypi.org/help/#file-name-reuse>`__ as normal.
