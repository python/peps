Abstract
========

Since Python 3.11.0, CPython has provided two verifiable digital signatures for all CPython artifacts: PGP and Sigstore.

PGP's design requires the maintenance and protection of `long-lived private keys <https://words.filippo.io/giving-up-on-long-term-pgp/>`_ by trusted parties. PGP's `security and ergonomics have been criticized by security practitioners <https://www.latacora.com/blog/2019/07/16/the-pgp-problem/>`_ for many years now, with the biggest issue being that there were few alternatives for "artifact signing" being proposed or adopted.

Sigstore's design philosophy has focused on the ergonomics of signing and verifying and uses short-lived keys with strongly-bound human-readable identities via OpenID Connect. Sigstore has both development and adoption momentum, seeing adoption by PyPI, NPM, Homebrew, GitHub, among other ecosystems.

This PEP proposes to move CPython to using Sigstore exclusively for signing artifacts through a deprecation and eventual discontinuance of providing PGP signatures with new release managers.

Motivation
==========

CPython's releases are release-manager-centric, where a single person maintains multiple CPython releases from pre-release to end-of-life over the course of many years.

Requiring release managers to maintain and protect PGP private keys for seven or more years is an unnecessary burden in the new age of ergonomic and ephemeral signing keys. Comparatively, Sigstore only requires release managers to click a button during the release process to OAuth sign-on to their identity provider. Maintaining the integrity of accounts on identity providers like GitHub is already an expectation of being a Python release manager or core developer, such as through multi-factor authentication and strong unique passwords.

Rationale
=========

Preserve expectations across a Python release
---------------------------------------------

To avoid breaking downstream verifiers, the expectations for verification materials availability SHOULD NOT be changed during a Python releases' lifecycle.

Release managers, not releases
------------------------------

The discontinuation of PGP signatures doesn't necessarily have to happen
on a "release manager boundary", a new Python release could be a potential boundary.

Because the primary motivation for deprecating PGP is ergonomics, deciding to drop PGP for one release while a release manager still has obligations to provide PGP signatures for other releases for multiple years isn't much savings of effort.

A new release manager also represents a new PGP public key that downstream verifiers need to adopt. By choosing to make the change during this period, this minimizes the breakage to a place in downstream maintenance where a change will already be necessary.

Gordian knot of signing methods and verifiers
---------------------------------------------

CPython providing both PGP and Sigstore signatures concurrently creates a "`Gordian knot <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordian_Knot>`_" where verifiers are disincentivized to migrate to a new signature method due to the *continued and expected availability* of an existing signature method, thus propogating the *apparent demand* for maintaining the existing signature method.

This situation slows down the adoption of Sigstore downstream vertically between ecosystems and horizontally across ecosystems by not creating a "need" to automate and integrate the signature method into verifier tooling.

By changing the expectation of what future signature methods will be available, the incentive-knot can be broken by `spurring the adoption of the new signature method in downstream tooling <https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2024/10/msg00025.html>`_. This change to verifier tooling also makes other upstream projects able to migrate to publishing only Sigstore signatures, resulting in a positive feedback loop of adoption.

Specification
=============

Because PGP keys are tied to a release manager identity, the change to availability of PGP signatures will be tied to release managers instead of individual releases (3.13, 3.14, etc). This PEP both deprecates and proposes a discontinuation timeline for PGP signatures.

Deprecation and discontinuation of PGP signatures
-------------------------------------------------

This PEP deprecates PGP signatures for future CPython releases and recommends verifiers to adopt Sigstore to verify CPython artifacts as an alternative to PGP.

This PEP also removes the expectation that PGP signatures be published by future release managers that don't already maintain a stable Python release. At the time of writing this would be Hugo van Kemenade, as 3.14 is the next Python version without a stable release.

Releases which already have a stable release (3.13, 3.12, 3.11, etc) are not affected and will continue to provide PGP signatures for artifacts until they are end-of-life. All existing PGP signatures will continue to work as expected.

Delaying discontinuation of PGP signatures
------------------------------------------

This PEP provides a mechanism to delay the *discontinuation* of PGP signatures from active and upcoming CPython releases in case of extraordinary circumstances. *Deprecation* of PGP signatures can't be changed without a superseding PEP.

The Steering Council MAY at a future date after this PEP's acceptance decide to delay the discontinuation of PGP signatures to a future CPython release. If the Steering Council decides to delay the discontinuation of PGP signatures then all active release managers MUST provide PGP signatures for their covered CPython artifacts for the remainder of their tenure as a release manager. This includes all steps required to do so, such as generating a new PGP key and publishing their identity to python.org.

The discontinuation of PGP signatures then is automatically scheduled for the next release manager without a stable release, to be highlighted in the Steering Council decision.

Backwards Compatibility
=======================

This proposal would remove the ability to verify future CPython artifacts using PGP. Any downstream verifiers using PGP for CPython artifacts would need to either start using Sigstore, verify their source code of CPython through other means, or stop verification altogether for future CPython releases.

Security Implications
=====================

PGP and Sigstore have different security models, so by removing PGP signatures this means that all users only have the option to rely on the security model provided by Sigstore.

In general, the security model required for artifact signatures is being able to detect whether a given artifact is from the expected source and hasn't been modified, regardless of the security or integrity of the hosting service (in CPython's case: python.org/downloads).

`Sigstore's security model <https://docs.sigstore.dev/about/security/>`_ depends more on centralized infrastructure compared to PGP, such as the "public good" signature transparency log (Rekor), certificate authority and transparency log (Fulcio), and the security of OpenID Connect identity providers like Google and GitHub.

CPython's development already depends on the security of some of these services and the others are better resourced than any individual release manager to provide long-term public key management.

How to Teach This
=================

CPython `already documents <https://www.python.org/downloads/metadata/sigstore/>`_ how to verify artifacts using Sigstore based on the pre-published identities of release managers. Documentation will be updated to indicate the deprecation and future expectations of PGP signatures.

Verifying signatures of CPython artifacts isn't something we should expect from new Python users. Instead, Sigstore is more likely to be a part of a downstream integrators' build pipeline such as a Linux distro, Homebrew, pyenv, or others that programmatically fetch and build CPython from source.

Rejected Ideas
==============

Continue publishing PGP signatures indefinitely
-----------------------------------------------

Being a release manager is already a difficult, time-consuming, and long-term commitment that is typically done on a volunteer basis. Thus we see removal of PGP key management duties as a step towards reducing burnout and stress of future release managers and improving the sustainability of CPython.

Support for offline verification
--------------------------------

During the `pre-PEP discussion <https://discuss.python.org/t/pre-pep-discussion-stop-providing-gpg-signatures-for-cpython-artifacts/65058>`_, there was a question of whether offline verification was supported by Sigstore. Using a Sigstore bundle (`.sigstore`) file, `Sigstore clients support verifying the artifact completely offline <https://discuss.python.org/t/pre-pep-discussion-stop-providing-gpg-signatures-for-cpython-artifacts/65058/9>`_. When in offline mode, Sigstore can't verify whether a signature has been revoked. This is a similar restriction to PGP key revocations not being detectable during offline verification.
