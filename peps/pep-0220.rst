Abstract
========

Demonstrates why the changes described in the stackless PEP are
desirable.  A low-level continuations module exists.  With it,
coroutines and generators and "green" threads can be written.  A
higher level module that makes coroutines and generators easy to
create is desirable (and being worked on).  The focus of this PEP
is on showing how coroutines, generators, and green threads can
simplify common programming problems.
