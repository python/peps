Abstract
========

This PEP defines the use of information about the interpreter ABI as
environment markers for project dependencies through a new ``sys_abi_info``
environment marker variable. :pep:`508` (later moved to
:ref:`packaging:dependency-specifiers`) introduced environment markers to
specify dependencies based on rules that describe when the dependency should
be used. This PEP extends environment markers to allow specifying dependencies
based on specific information about the ABI of the Python interpreter. For
this, it defines a set of `ABI Features`_ and specifies how they are made
available for `environment markers <pep-780-sys_abi_info_>`_ via a new marker
variable, ``sys_abi_info``.

Motivation
==========

In 2015, :pep:`508` established environment markers to specify dependencies
based on environment conditions. The development of free-threaded CPython
[#python-free-threading]_ has underlined the need for an environment marker to
discriminate between different ABI features that the interpreter was built
with. For example, currently there is no way to distinguish between a
GIL-enabled and a free-threaded CPython interpreter with an environment marker.
This leads to real world issues for the adoption of free-threading and its
incremental rollout. When a Python package is being made compatible with
free-threaded CPython, it also needs all its build and runtime dependencies to
be compatible. Capturing the first version of a dependency that is compatible
precisely in metadata is currently not possible, and increasing the minimum
version of a dependency also for the GIL-enabled build is usually undesirable
since it unnecessarily limits compatibility between packages.

Some concrete examples of such issues have been discussed in the `Environment
marker for free-threading`_ Discourse thread:

- Cython has (experimental) support for free-threading only in its master
  branch, and is used by a lot of projects that already publish ``cp313t``
  wheels. Picking up the wrong Cython version is causing a lot of obscure build
  failures and runtime crashes. It would be beneficial if the metadata could
  express that (c.f. `Require Cython Pre-release for Free-Threaded Python`_).
- CFFI has only recently gained support for free-threading, and for a
  significant period of time, it looked likely that support would first be
  added in a fork. There are a lot of projects that depend on ``cffi``, which
  are likely fine to start depending on a fork for free-threading only, however
  depending on a fork for >=3.13 or for all Python versions seemed like a much
  larger ask, and more disruptive for distribution packagers. While the
  situation has been resolved with CFFI 2.0.0, other projects may face similar
  issues.

While concrete examples may be addressed with compatible releases, the same
issue is going to repeat further up the stack. The free-threading rollout is
expected to take several years, and an environment marker for free-threading
will make that rollout significantly easier.

Another important ABI feature that is not yet covered by environment markers is
the bitness of the interpreter. In most cases, the ``sys_platform`` or
``platform_system`` markers are enough, because there is only a single bitness
in use per platform. This is not the case on Windows however: both 32-bit and
64-bit Python interpreters are widely used on x86-64 Windows. Not being able to
distinguish between the two may be relevant for packages that provide compiled
extensions. For example, SciPy does not provide ``win32`` wheels (it isn't able
to due to the lack of a suitable 32-bit compiler toolchain with Fortran
support). Those wheels lacking can be awkward especially for projects where
SciPy is an optional dependency only. In that case, it would be useful to be
able to specify that SciPy is required *unless* the interpreter is a 32-bit one
on Windows (c.f. `Require SciPy Unless on 32-bit win32`_), to avoid failed
from-source installations due to the missing wheels.


Rationale
=========

The intention of this PEP is to introduce its core features with minimal impact
on the existing ecosystem. The existing grammar proposed in :pep:`508` lends
itself to a straightforward extension to include the new environment marker.

A Forward Looking View on Free-Threaded Python
----------------------------------------------

:pep:`703`, the accepted proposal for free threading, states that the rollout
of free-threaded Python should be gradual, which has been clarified by the
Python Steering Council in `the PEP 703 acceptance post`_ to mean a three stage
process over multiple releases. It is therefore important to make sure that the
mechanisms in this PEP are useable for Python interpreters where either
free-threading or non-free-threading could be the default or the only option.

At the time of writing, free-threaded Python is in Phase I: experimental phase.
In this phase, there is an acute need for the proposed environment markers to
help with the transition to free-threaded Python as package authors gradually
add support.

As the number of packages with support increases, and particularly during
Phase II: Supported-but-not-default phase, we still anticipate a strong need
for the environment markers to help with the transition.

As free-threaded Python enters into Phase III: Default phase, the need for the
environment markers will decrease, though at this point it is not clear that
the GIL-enabled Python will be completely phased out (it may remain available
as a non standard build option). If it persists, the inverse need for the ABI
feature detection may arise.

Indeed, in all three phases it may be necessary for package authors to choose
specific versions of their dependencies based on the ABI features, with a shift
from GIL-enabled as default to free-threading as default over time.

The ABI features are designed with this in mind to guarantee usefulness and
simplicity for the foreseeable future in a changing Python ecosystem.

Relation to Other PEPs
----------------------

This PEP extends environment markers with set semantics for ABI features.
:pep:`751#additions-to-marker-expression-syntax` includes a similar extension
for lock file specific environment markers; although the two have been
developed independently, they are compatible where they overlap in terms of the
new set semantics.

Specification
=============

The keywords "**MUST**", "**MUST NOT**", "**REQUIRED**", "**SHALL**",
"**SHALL NOT**", "**SHOULD**", "**SHOULD NOT**", "**RECOMMENDED**", "**MAY**",
and "**OPTIONAL**"" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
:rfc:`RFC 2119 <2119>`.

ABI Features
------------

ABI features are intrinsic properties of the Python interpreter.
However, not all features are equally applicable to all Python interpreters or
Python versions. For example, the distinction between free-threaded and
GIL-enabled interpreters is only relevant for CPython 3.13 onwards, but the
bitness of the interpreter, i.e. the number of bits in a pointer, is relevant
for all interpreters.

All interpreters MUST handle the following ABI features as stated. ABI features
that are restricted to particular interpreters MUST NOT be provided by other
interpreters.

In Python 3.15 and later, the ABI features are determined by the new
:external+py3.15:py:data:`sys.abi_info` attribute. In earlier Python versions,
the ABI features are the same as for Python 3.15 and given as follows:

``pointer_bits``
    The bitness of the interpreter, that is, the number of bits in a pointer,
    typically ``32`` or ``64`` [#bitness]_.

``free_threaded`` (only CPython)
    If the Python interpreter is free-threaded, ``free_threaded`` MUST be
    ``True``, otherwise it MUST be ``False``.

``debug`` (only CPython)
    This ABI feature corresponds to the
    :external+py3.15:py:attr:`sys.abi_info.debug` field.

``byteorder``
    Indicates the byte order of the interpreter. The value MUST be either
    ``"little"`` or ``"big"``.

.. _pep-780-sys_abi_info:

The ``sys_abi_info`` Environment Marker
---------------------------------------

To make ABI features available in dependency specifications, a new environment
marker variable, ``sys_abi_info``, is added to the format of dependency
specifiers. It is built to reflect the value of ``sys.abi_info``, which is a
new attribute of the ``sys`` module introduced in Python 3.15 as a simple
namespace. To represent its fields in the environment marker variable, they are
expressed as a frozen set of strings of the form ``f"{name}::{value}"``, where
``name`` is the name of the field and ``value`` is the string representation of
its value.

The ``sys_abi_info`` Environment Variable
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
To do this, we need to extend the grammar laid out in :pep:`508` and maintained
in the :ref:`packaging:dependency-specifiers` and document the possible values,
to include the ``sys_abi_info`` marker variable by augmenting the definition of
``env_var`` as follows::

    env_var       = ('python_version' | 'python_full_version' |
                     'os_name' | 'sys_platform' | 'platform_release' |
                     'platform_system' | 'platform_version' |
                     'platform_machine' | 'platform_python_implementation' |
                     'implementation_name' | 'implementation_version' |
                     'sys_abi_info' |
                     'extra' | 'extras' | 'dependency_groups' # ONLY when defined by a containing layer
                     )

This makes ``sys_abi_info`` available as a variable in marker expressions.

The Values of ``sys_abi_info``
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
Like the grammar, also the overview table of environment markers in
:ref:`packaging:dependency-specifiers` is augmented to add the following row:

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Marker
      - Python equivalent
      - Sample values
    * - ``sys_abi_info``
      - ``sys.abi_info``
      - ``{'free_threaded::True', 'pointer_bits::64'}``,
        ``{'free_threaded::False', 'debug::True', 'pointer_bits::32'}``,
        ``{'byteorder::little', 'pointer_bits::64'}``

With these additions, ABI features can be used in dependency specifications via
the ``in`` operator to test for the presence of a feature, or the ``not in``
operator to test for the absence of a feature.

This allows for marker expressions such as::

    "free_threaded::True" in sys_abi_info
    "pointer_bits::32" not in sys_abi_info and "debug::True" in sys_abi_info

Note that this is forward compatible in the sense that future additions to the
set of ABI features will not be in conflict with the grammar, such that tools
encountering unknown ABI features in a dependency specification will naturally
evaluate the test as false. This empowers package authors to decide on the
default resolution in this case. For example, a package author may decide to
require a dependency only if an ABI feature is present, by using a presence
test like ``"new_feature::True" in sys_abi_info``, which will evaluate to
false on current interpreters that do not support the new feature, or an
absence test like ``"new_feature::False" not in sys_abi_info``, which will
evaluate to true on current interpreters.

While covering all ABI features specified at the moment, this mechanism is only
meaningfully applicable where the ABI feature is unambiguously representable as
a string. Currently, all ABI features are either booleans, integers, or
strings, which all satisfy this requirement.

Should the future reveal a need for ABI features that are not unambiguously
represented as strings, like floating point numbers or more complex data
structures, this PEP would need to be revisited to address those.

Examples
========

Require Cython Pre-release for Free-Threaded Python
---------------------------------------------------
To require a pre-release of Cython only for a free-threaded Python interpreter,
the following dependency specification can be used::

    cython >3.1.0a1; "free_threaded::True" in sys_abi_info
    cython ==3.0.*; "free_threaded::False" in sys_abi_info

Require SciPy Unless on 32-bit ``win32``
----------------------------------------
To require SciPy unless on a 32-bit interpreter on Windows, the following
dependency specification can be used::

    scipy; platform_system != "Windows" or "pointer_bits::32" not in sys_abi_info

Require NumPy for a Free-Threaded Interpreter With Debugging Capabilities
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
To require NumPy only for a free-threaded interpreter with debugging
capabilities, the following dependency can be used::

    numpy; "free-threaded::True" in sys_abi_info and "debug::True" in sys_abi_info

Require Free-Threaded Fork of PyYAML
------------------------------------
PyYAML initially decided not to support free-threading in its mainline
distribution before wider testing of free-threaded Python in the real world.
To facilitate this testing, a free-threaded fork, PyYAML-ft, was created.
To require this fork, for a free-threaded Python interpreter, without forcing
it also on the GIL-enabled interpreter, the following dependency specification
can be used::

    pyyaml-ft; "free_threaded::True" in sys_abi_info
    pyyaml; "free_threaded::True" not in sys_abi_info

Note that in the absence of the features described in this PEP, early adopting
projects have had to resort to using the fork for *all* builds of a potentially
free threading Python interpreter; typical dependencies than look like::

    pyyaml; python_version<"3.13"
    pyyaml-ft; python_version>="3.13"

which is an undesirable side effect for GIL-enabled environments.

Backwards Compatibility
=======================

This is a pure extension to the existing environment markers and does not
affect existing environment markers or dependency specifications, hence there
are no direct backwards compatibility concerns.

However, the introduction of the feature has implications for a number of
ecosystem tools, especially those which attempt to support examination of data
in ``pyproject.toml`` and ``requirements.txt``.

In particular, current tools generally work with a fixed list of environment
variables, either in their own implementation (e.g. `uv`_) or via an
established package like `pypa/packaging`_ (e.g. pip).
Hence, it is principally impossible to add any new environment markers without
making new packages using these markers incompatible with older versions of
these tools.
However, once these tools support the proposed marker variable, changes in its
contents are handled gracefully.

Audit and Update Tools
----------------------

A wide range of tools understand Python dependency data as expressed in
``requirements.txt`` files. (e.g., Dependabot, Tidelift, etc)

Such tools inspect dependency data and, in some cases, offer tool-assisted or
fully automated updates. It is our expectation that no such tools would support
the new environment markers at first, and broad ecosystem support could take
many months or even some number of years to arrive.

As a result, users of the new environment markers would experience a
degradation in their workflows and tool support at the time that they start
using them. This is true of any new standard for where and how dependency data
are encoded.

Security Implications
=====================

This PEP introduces new syntax for specifying dependency information in
projects. However, it does not introduce newly specified mechanisms for
handling or resolving dependencies.

It therefore does not carry security concerns other than those inherent in any
tools which may already be used to install dependencies---i.e. malicious
dependencies may be specified here, just as they may be specified in
``requirements.txt`` files.

How to Teach This
=================

The use of environment markers is well established and communicated chiefly in
:ref:`packaging:dependency-specifiers`. The new environment marker can be
introduced in the same document. Additionally, both for package authors and
users, free-threading specific guidance can be provided at the
`Python free-threading guide`_.

Reference Implementation
========================

The reference implementation for the environment markers is available in a fork
of the ``packaging`` library at `Environment markers for ABI features
<https://github.com/zklaus/packaging/pull/1>`__.

`A demonstration package <https://github.com/zklaus/env-marker-example>`__ is
also available.

Since ``pip`` uses a vendored copy of ``packaging`` internally, we also provide
`a patched version of pip`__, which replaces the vendored ``packaging`` with
the reference implementation linked above.

Rejected Ideas
==============

Extension Mechanism
-------------------

In an early discussion of the topic (`Environment marker for free-threading`_),
the idea of a general extension mechanism for environment markers was brought
up. While it is appealing to forego a whole PEP process should the need for
new environment markers arise in the future, there are two main challenges.

First, a completely dynamic mechanism would present difficulties for tools that
rely on static analysis of dependency specifications.

This means that even if a dynamic mechanism were to be adopted, new environment
markers would likely still need to be spelled out in a PEP.

Second, the introduction of a dynamic mechanism would require a more complex
implementation in the packaging library, which would be a significant departure
from the current approach.

Open Issues
===========

Other Environment Markers
-------------------------
If other environment markers are needed right now, this PEP could be extended
to include them.

Other Tooling
-------------
The reference implementation is based on the ``packaging`` library and ``pip``.
We have confirmed that this allows for building and installing packages with
several build backends. It is possible that other tools should be added to the
reference implementation.
