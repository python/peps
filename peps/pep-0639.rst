Provisional Acceptance
======================

This PEP has been **provisionally accepted**,
with the following required conditions before the PEP is made Final:

1. An implementation of the PEP in two build back-ends.
2. An implementation of the PEP in PyPI.


.. _639-abstract:

Abstract
========

This PEP defines a specification how licenses are documented in the Python
projects.

To achieve that, it:

- Adopts the `SPDX license expression syntax <639-spdx_>`__ as a
  means of expressing the license for a Python project.

- Defines how to include license files within the projects, source and built
  distributions.

- Specifies the necessary changes to :term:`Core Metadata` and
  the corresponding :term:`Pyproject Metadata key`\s

- Describes the necessary changes to
  the `source distribution (sdist) <sdistspec_>`__,
  `built distribution (wheel) <wheelspec_>`__ and
  `installed project <installedspec_>`__ standards.

This will make license declaration simpler and less ambiguous for
package authors to create, end users to understand,
and tools to programmatically process.

The changes will update the
`Core Metadata specification <coremetadataspec_>`__ to version 2.4.

.. _639-goals:

Goals
=====

This PEP's scope is limited to covering new mechanisms for documenting
the license of a :term:`distribution package`, specifically defining:

- A means of specifying a SPDX :term:`license expression`.
- A method of including license texts in :term:`distribution package`\s
  and installed :term:`Project`\s.

The changes that this PEP requires have been designed to minimize impact and
maximize backward compatibility.


.. _639-non-goals:

Non-Goals
=========

This PEP doesn't recommend any particular license to be chosen by any
particular package author.

If projects decide not to use the new fields, no additional restrictions are
imposed by this PEP when uploading to PyPI.

This PEP also is not about license documentation for individual files,
though this is a :ref:`surveyed topic <639-license-doc-source-files>`
in an appendix, nor does it intend to cover cases where the
:term:`source distribution <Source Distribution (or "sdist")>` and
:term:`binary distribution` packages don't have
:ref:`the same licenses <639-rejected-ideas-difference-license-source-binary>`.


.. _639-motivation:

Motivation
==========

Software must be licensed in order for anyone other than its creator to
download, use, share and modify it.
Today, there are multiple fields where licenses
are documented in :term:`Core Metadata`,
and there are limitations to what can be expressed in each of them.
This often leads to confusion both for package authors
and end users, including distribution re-packagers.

This has triggered a number of license-related discussions and issues,
including on `outdated and ambiguous PyPI classifiers <classifierissue_>`__,
`license interoperability with other ecosystems <interopissue_>`__,
`too many confusing license metadata options <packagingissue_>`__,
`limited support for license files in the Wheel project <wheelfiles_>`__, and
`the lack of precise license metadata <pepissue_>`__.

As a result, on average, Python packages tend to have more ambiguous and
missing license information than other common ecosystems. This is supported by
the `statistics page <cdstats_>`__ of the
`ClearlyDefined project <clearlydefined_>`__, an
`Open Source Initiative <osi_>`__ effort to help
improve licensing clarity of other FOSS projects, covering all packages
from PyPI, Maven, npm and Rubygems.

The current license classifiers could be extended to include the full range of
the SPDX identifiers while deprecating the ambiguous classifiers
(such as ``License :: OSI Approved :: BSD License``).

However, there are multiple arguments against such an approach:

- It requires a great effort to duplicate the SPDX license list and keep it in
  sync.

- It is a hard break in backward compatibility, forcing package authors
  to update to new classifiers immediately when PyPI deprecates the old ones.

- It only covers packages under a single license;
  it doesn't address projects that vendor dependencies (e.g. Setuptools),
  offer a choice of licenses (e.g. Packaging) or were relicensed,
  adapt code from other projects or contain fonts, images,
  examples, binaries or other assets under other licenses.

- It requires both authors and tools understand and implement the PyPI-specific
  classifier system.

- It does not provide as clear an indicator that a package
  has adopted the new system, and should be treated accordingly.


.. _639-rationale:

Rationale
=========

A survey was conducted to map the existing license metadata
definitions in the :ref:`Python ecosystem <639-license-doc-python>` and a
:ref:`variety of other packaging systems, Linux distributions,
language ecosystems and applications <639-license-doc-other-projects>`.

The takeaways from the survey have guided the recommendations of this PEP:

- SPDX and SPDX-like syntaxes are the most popular :term:`license expression`\s
  in many modern package systems.

- Most Free and Open Source Software licenses require package authors to
  include their full text in a :term:`Distribution Package`.

Therefore, this PEP introduces two new Core Metadata fields:

- :ref:`License-Expression <639-spec-field-license-expression>` that
  provides an unambiguous way to express the license of a package
  using SPDX license expressions.

- :ref:`License-File <639-spec-field-license-file>` that
  offers a standardized way to include the full text of the license(s)
  with the package when distributed,
  and allows other tools consuming the :term:`Core Metadata`
  to locate a :term:`distribution archive`'s license files.

Furthermore, this specification builds upon
existing practice in the `Setuptools <setuptoolsfiles_>`__ and
`Wheel <wheelfiles_>`__ projects.
An up-to-date version of the current draft of this PEP is
`implemented <hatchimplementation_>`__ in the
`Hatch <hatch_>`__ packaging tool, and an earlier draft of the
:ref:`license files portion <639-spec-field-license-file>`
is `implemented in Setuptools <setuptoolspep639_>`__.


.. _639-terminology:

Terminology
===========

The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL"
in this document are to be interpreted as described in :rfc:`2119`.


.. _639-terminology-license:

License terms
-------------

The license-related terminology draws heavily from the `SPDX Project <spdx_>`__,
particularly :term:`license identifier` and :term:`license expression`.

.. glossary::

    license classifier
        A `PyPI Trove classifier <classifiers_>`__
        (as :ref:`described <packaging:core-metadata-classifier>`
        in the :term:`Core Metadata` specification)
        which begins with ``License ::``.

    license expression
    SPDX expression
        A string with valid `SPDX license expression syntax <spdxpression_>`__
        including one or more SPDX :term:`license identifier`\(s),
        which describes a :term:`Project`'s license(s)
        and how they inter-relate.
        Examples:
        ``GPL-3.0-or-later``,
        ``MIT AND (Apache-2.0 OR BSD-2-clause)``

    license identifier
    SPDX identifier
        A valid `SPDX short-form license identifier <spdxid_>`__,
        as described in the
        :ref:`639-spec-field-license-expression` section of this PEP.
        This includes all valid SPDX identifiers and
        the custom ``LicenseRef-[idstring]`` strings conforming to the
        `SPDX specification, clause 10.1 <spdxcustom_>`__.
        Examples:
        ``MIT``,
        ``GPL-3.0-only``,
        ``LicenseRef-My-Custom-License``

    root license directory
    license directory
        The directory under which license files are stored in a
        :term:`project source tree`, :term:`distribution archive`
        or :term:`installed project`.
        Also, the root directory that their paths
        recorded in the :ref:`License-File <639-spec-field-license-file>`
        :term:`Core Metadata field` are relative to.
        Defined to be the :term:`project root directory`
        for a :term:`project source tree` or
        :term:`source distribution <Source Distribution (or "sdist")>`;
        and a subdirectory named ``licenses`` of
        the directory containing the :term:`built metadata`—
        i.e., the ``.dist-info/licenses`` directory—
        for a :term:`Built Distribution` or :term:`installed project`.


.. _639-specification:

Specification
=============

The changes necessary to implement this PEP include:

- additions to :ref:`Core Metadata <639-spec-core-metadata>`,
  as defined in the `specification <coremetadataspec_>`__.

- additions to the author-provided
  :ref:`project source metadata <639-spec-source-metadata>`,
  as defined in the `specification <pyprojecttoml_>`__.

- :ref:`additions <639-spec-project-formats>` to the
  source distribution (sdist), built distribution (wheel) and installed project
  specifications.

- :ref:`guide for tools <639-spec-converting-metadata>`
  handling and converting legacy license metadata to license
  expressions, to ensure the results are consistent and correct.

Note that the guidance on errors and warnings is for tools' default behavior;
they MAY operate more strictly if users explicitly configure them to do so,
such as by a CLI flag or a configuration option.


.. _639-spdx:

SPDX license expression syntax
------------------------------

This PEP adopts the SPDX license expression syntax as
documented in the `SPDX specification <spdxpression_>`__, either
Version 2.2 or a later compatible version.

A license expression can use the following :term:`license identifier`\s:

- Any SPDX-listed license short-form identifiers that are published in the
  `SPDX License List <spdxlist_>`__, version 3.17 or any later compatible
  version. Note that the SPDX working group never removes any license
  identifiers; instead, they may choose to mark an identifier as "deprecated".

- The custom ``LicenseRef-[idstring]`` string(s), where
  ``[idstring]`` is a unique string containing letters, numbers,
  ``.`` and/or ``-``, to identify licenses that are not included in the SPDX
  license list. The custom identifiers must follow the SPDX specification,
  `clause 10.1 <spdxcustom_>`__ of the given specification version.


Examples of valid SPDX expressions:

.. code-block:: none

    MIT
    BSD-3-Clause
    MIT AND (Apache-2.0 OR BSD-2-Clause)
    MIT OR GPL-2.0-or-later OR (FSFUL AND BSD-2-Clause)
    GPL-3.0-only WITH Classpath-Exception-2.0 OR BSD-3-Clause
    LicenseRef-Special-License OR CC0-1.0 OR Unlicense
    LicenseRef-Proprietary


Examples of invalid SPDX expressions:

.. code-block:: none

    Use-it-after-midnight
    Apache-2.0 OR 2-BSD-Clause
    LicenseRef-License with spaces
    LicenseRef-License_with_underscores


.. _639-spec-core-metadata:

Core Metadata
-------------

The error and warning guidance in this section applies to build and
publishing tools; end-user-facing install tools MAY be less strict than
mentioned here when encountering malformed metadata
that does not conform to this specification.

As it adds new fields, this PEP updates the Core Metadata version to 2.4.


.. _639-spec-field-license-expression:

Add ``License-Expression`` field
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The ``License-Expression`` optional :term:`Core Metadata field`
is specified to contain a text string
that is a valid SPDX :term:`license expression`,
as :ref:`defined above <639-spdx>`.

Build and publishing tools SHOULD
check that the ``License-Expression`` field contains a valid SPDX expression,
including the validity of the particular license identifiers
(as :ref:`defined above <639-spdx>`).
Tools MAY halt execution and raise an error when an invalid expression is found.
If tools choose to validate the SPDX expression, they also SHOULD
store a case-normalized version of the ``License-Expression``
field using the reference case for each SPDX license identifier and uppercase
for the ``AND``, ``OR`` and ``WITH`` keywords.
Tools SHOULD report a warning and publishing tools MAY raise an error
if one or more license identifiers
have been marked as deprecated in the `SPDX License List <spdxlist_>`__.

For all newly-uploaded :term:`distribution archive`\s
that include a ``License-Expression`` field,
the `Python Package Index (PyPI) <pypi_>`__ MUST
validate that they contain a valid, case-normalized license expression with
valid identifiers (as :ref:`defined above <639-spdx>`)
and MUST reject uploads that do not.
Custom license identifiers which conform to the SPDX specification
are considered valid.
PyPI MAY reject an upload for using a deprecated license identifier,
so long as it was deprecated as of the above-mentioned SPDX License List
version.


.. _639-spec-field-license-file:

Add ``License-File`` field
''''''''''''''''''''''''''

``License-File`` is an optional :term:`Core Metadata field`.
Each instance contains the string
representation of the path of a license-related file. The path is located
within the :term:`project source tree`, relative to the
:term:`project root directory`.
It is a multi-use field that may appear zero or
more times and each instance lists the path to one such file. Files specified
under this field could include license text, author/attribution information,
or other legal notices that need to be distributed with the package.

As :ref:`specified by this PEP <639-spec-project-formats>`, its value
is also that file's path relative to the :term:`root license directory`
in both :term:`installed project`\s
and the standardized :term:`Distribution Package` types.

If a ``License-File`` is listed in a
:term:`Source Distribution <Source Distribution (or "sdist")>` or
:term:`Built Distribution`'s Core Metadata:

- That file MUST be included in the :term:`distribution archive` at the
  specified path relative to the root license directory.

- That file MUST be installed with the :term:`project` at that same relative
  path.

- The specified relative path MUST be consistent between project source trees,
  source distributions (sdists), built distributions (:term:`Wheel`\s) and
  installed projects.

- Inside the root license directory, packaging tools MUST reproduce the
  directory structure under which the source license files are located
  relative to the project root.

- Path delimiters MUST be the forward slash character (``/``),
  and parent directory indicators (``..``) MUST NOT be used.

- License file content MUST be UTF-8 encoded text.

Build tools MAY and publishing tools SHOULD produce an informative warning
if a built distribution's metadata contains no ``License-File`` entries,
and publishing tools MAY but build tools MUST NOT raise an error.

For all newly-uploaded :term:`distribution archive`\s that include one or more
``License-File`` fields in their Core Metadata
and declare a ``Metadata-Version`` of ``2.4`` or higher,
PyPI SHOULD validate that all specified files are present in that
:term:`distribution archive`\s,
and MUST reject uploads that do not validate.


.. _639-spec-field-license:

Deprecate ``License`` field
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The legacy unstructured-text ``License`` :term:`Core Metadata field`
is deprecated and replaced by the new ``License-Expression`` field.
The fields are mutually exclusive.
Tools which generate Core Metadata MUST NOT create both these fields.
Tools which read Core Metadata, when dealing with both these fields present
at the same time, MUST read the value of ``License-Expression`` and MUST
disregard the value of the ``License`` field.

If only the ``License`` field is present, tools MAY issue a warning
informing users it is deprecated and recommending ``License-Expression``
instead.

For all newly-uploaded :term:`distribution archive`\s that include a
``License-Expression`` field, the `Python Package Index (PyPI) <pypi_>`__ MUST
reject any that specify both ``License`` and ``License-Expression`` fields.

The ``License`` field may be removed from a new version of the specification
in a future PEP.


.. _639-spec-field-classifier:

Deprecate license classifiers
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Using :term:`license classifier`\s
in the ``Classifier`` :term:`Core Metadata field`
(`described in the Core Metadata specification <coremetadataclassifiers_>`__)
is deprecated and replaced by the more precise ``License-Expression`` field.

If the ``License-Expression`` field is present, build tools MAY raise an error
if one or more license classifiers
is included in a ``Classifier`` field, and MUST NOT add
such classifiers themselves.

Otherwise, if this field contains a license classifier,
tools MAY issue a warning informing users such classifiers
are deprecated, and recommending ``License-Expression`` instead.
For compatibility with existing publishing and installation processes,
the presence of license classifiers SHOULD NOT raise an error unless
``License-Expression`` is also provided.

New license classifiers MUST NOT be `added to PyPI <classifiersrepo_>`__;
users needing them SHOULD use the ``License-Expression`` field instead.
License classifiers may be removed from a new version of the specification
in a future PEP.


.. _639-spec-source-metadata:

Project source metadata
-----------------------

This PEP specifies changes to the project's source
metadata under a ``[project]`` table in the ``pyproject.toml`` file.


.. _639-spec-key-license-text:

Add string value to ``license`` key
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

``license`` key in the ``[project]`` table is defined to contain a top-level
string value. It is a valid SPDX license expression as
:ref:`defined in this PEP <639-spdx>`.
Its value maps to the ``License-Expression`` field in the core metadata.

Build tools SHOULD validate and perform case normalization of the expression
as described in the
:ref:`639-spec-field-license-expression` section,
outputting an error or warning as specified.

Examples:

.. code-block:: toml

    [project]
    license = "MIT"

    [project]
    license = "MIT AND (Apache-2.0 OR BSD-2-clause)"

    [project]
    license = "MIT OR GPL-2.0-or-later OR (FSFUL AND BSD-2-Clause)"

    [project]
    license = "LicenseRef-Proprietary"


.. _639-spec-key-license-files:

Add ``license-files`` key
'''''''''''''''''''''''''

A new ``license-files`` key is added to the ``[project]`` table for specifying
paths in the project source tree relative to ``pyproject.toml`` to file(s)
containing licenses and other legal notices to be distributed with the package.
It corresponds to the ``License-File`` fields in the Core Metadata.

Its value is an array of strings which MUST contain valid glob patterns,
as specified below:

- Alphanumeric characters, underscores (``_``), hyphens (``-``) and dots (``.``)
  MUST be matched verbatim.

- Special glob characters: ``*``, ``?``, ``**`` and character ranges: ``[]``
  containing only the verbatim matched characters MUST be supported.
  Within ``[...]``, the hyphen indicates a locale-agnostic range (e.g. ``a-z``,
  order based on Unicode code points).
  Hyphens at the start or end are matched literally.

- Path delimiters MUST be the forward slash character (``/``).
  Patterns are relative to the directory containing ``pyproject.toml``,
  therefore the leading slash character MUST NOT be used.

- Parent directory indicators (``..``) MUST NOT be used.

Any characters or character sequences not covered by this specification are
invalid. Projects MUST NOT use such values.
Tools consuming this field SHOULD reject invalid values with an error.

Tools MUST assume that license file content is valid UTF-8 encoded text,
and SHOULD validate this and raise an error if it is not.

Literal paths (e.g. ``LICENSE``) are treated as valid globs which means they
can also be defined.

Build tools:

- MUST treat each value as a glob pattern, and MUST raise an error if the
  pattern contains invalid glob syntax.

- MUST include all files matched by a listed pattern in all
  distribution archives.

- MUST list each matched file path under a ``License-File`` field in the
  Core Metadata.

- MUST raise an error if any individual user-specified pattern
  does not match at least one file.

If the ``license-files`` key is present and
is set to a value of an empty array, then tools MUST NOT include any
license files and MUST NOT raise an error.

Examples of valid license files declaration:

.. code-block:: toml

    [project]
    license-files = ["LICEN[CS]E*", "AUTHORS*"]

    [project]
    license-files = ["licenses/LICENSE.MIT", "licenses/LICENSE.CC0"]

    [project]
    license-files = ["LICENSE.txt", "licenses/*"]

    [project]
    license-files = []

Examples of invalid license files declaration:

.. code-block:: toml

    [project]
    license-files = ["..\LICENSE.MIT"]

Reason: ``..`` must not be used.
``\`` is an invalid path delimiter, ``/`` must be used.


.. code-block:: toml

    [project]
    license-files = ["LICEN{CSE*"]

Reason: "LICEN{CSE*" is not a valid glob.


.. _639-spec-key-license-table:

Deprecate ``license`` key table subkeys
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Table values for the ``license`` key in the ``[project]`` table,
including the ``text`` and ``file`` table subkeys, are now deprecated.
If the new ``license-files`` key is present,
build tools MUST raise an error if the ``license`` key is defined
and has a value other than a single top-level string.

If the new ``license-files`` key is not present
and the ``text`` subkey is present in a ``license`` table,
tools SHOULD issue a warning informing users it is deprecated
and recommending a license expression as a top-level string key instead.

Likewise, if the new ``license-files`` key is not present
and the ``file`` subkey is present in the ``license`` table,
tools SHOULD issue a warning informing users it is deprecated and recommending
the ``license-files`` key instead.

If the specified license ``file`` is present in the source tree,
build tools SHOULD use it to fill the ``License-File`` field
in the core metadata, and MUST include the specified file
as if it were specified in a ``license-file`` field.
If the file does not exist at the specified path,
tools MUST raise an informative error as previously specified.

Table values for the ``license`` key MAY be removed
from a new version of the specification in a future PEP.


.. _639-spec-project-formats:

License files in project formats
--------------------------------

A few additions will be made to the existing specifications.

:term:`Project source tree`\s
  Per :ref:`639-spec-source-metadata` section, the
  `Declaring Project Metadata specification <pyprojecttoml_>`__
  will be updated to reflect that license file paths MUST be relative to the
  project root directory; i.e. the directory containing the ``pyproject.toml``
  (or equivalently, other legacy project configuration,
  e.g. ``setup.py``, ``setup.cfg``, etc).

:term:`Source distributions (sdists) <Source Distribution (or "sdist")>`
  The `sdist specification <sdistspec_>`__ will be updated to reflect that if
  the ``Metadata-Version`` is ``2.4`` or greater,
  the sdist MUST contain any license files specified by
  the :ref:`License-File field <639-spec-field-license-file>`
  in the ``PKG-INFO`` at their respective paths
  relative to the  of the sdist
  (containing the ``pyproject.toml`` and the ``PKG-INFO`` Core Metadata).

:term:`Built distribution`\s (:term:`wheel`\s)
  The `Wheel specification <wheelspec_>`__ will be updated to reflect that if
  the ``Metadata-Version`` is ``2.4`` or greater and one or more
  ``License-File`` fields is specified, the ``.dist-info`` directory MUST
  contain a ``licenses`` subdirectory, which MUST contain the files listed
  in the ``License-File`` fields in the ``METADATA`` file at their respective
  paths relative to the ``licenses`` directory.

:term:`Installed project`\s
  The `Recording Installed Projects specification <installedspec_>`__ will be
  updated to reflect that if the ``Metadata-Version`` is ``2.4`` or greater
  and one or more ``License-File`` fields is specified, the ``.dist-info``
  directory MUST contain a ``licenses`` subdirectory which MUST contain
  the files listed in the ``License-File`` fields in the ``METADATA`` file
  at their respective paths relative to the ``licenses`` directory,
  and that any files in this directory MUST be copied from wheels
  by install tools.


.. _639-spec-converting-metadata:

Converting legacy metadata
--------------------------

Tools MUST NOT use the contents of the ``license.text`` ``[project]`` key
(or equivalent tool-specific format),
license classifiers or the value of the Core Metadata ``License`` field
to fill the top-level string value of the ``license`` key
or the Core Metadata ``License-Expression`` field
without informing the user and requiring unambiguous, affirmative user action
to select and confirm the desired license expression value before proceeding.

Tool authors, who need to automatically convert license classifiers to
SPDX identifiers, can use the
:ref:`recommendation <639-spec-mapping-classifiers-identifiers>` prepared by
the PEP authors.


.. _639-backwards-compatibility:

Backwards Compatibility
=======================

Adding a new ``License-Expression`` Core Metadata field and a top-level string
value for the ``license`` key in the ``pyproject.toml`` ``[project]`` table
unambiguously means support for the specification in this PEP. This avoids the
risk of new tooling misinterpreting a license expression as a free-form license
description or vice versa.

The legacy deprecated Core Metadata ``License`` field, ``license`` key table
subkeys (``text`` and ``file``) in the ``pyproject.toml`` ``[project]`` table
and license classifiers retain backwards compatibility. A removal is
left to a future PEP and a new version of the Core Metadata specification.

Specification of the new ``License-File`` Core Metadata field and adding the
files in the distribution is designed to be largely backwards-compatible with
the existing use of that field in many packaging tools.
The new ``license-files`` key in the ``[project]`` table of
``pyproject.toml`` will only have an effect once users and tools adopt it.

This PEP specifies that license files should be placed in a dedicated
``licenses`` subdir of ``.dist-info`` directory. This is new and ensures that
wheels following this PEP will have differently-located licenses relative to
those produced via the previous installer-specific behavior. This is further
supported by a new metadata version.

This also resolves current issues where license files are accidentally
replaced if they have the same names in different places, making wheels
undistributable without noticing. It also prevents conflicts with other
metadata files in the same directory.

The additions will be made to the source distribution (sdist), built
distribution (wheel) and installed project specifications. They document
behaviors allowed under their current specifications, and gate them behind the
new metadata version.

This PEP proposes PyPI implement validation of the new
``License-Expression`` and ``License-File`` fields, which has no effect on
new and existing packages uploaded unless they explicitly opt in to using
these new fields and fail to follow the specification correctly.
Therefore, this does not have a backward compatibility impact, and guarantees
forward compatibility by ensuring all distributions uploaded to PyPI with the
new fields conform to the specification.


.. _639-security-implications:

Security Implications
=====================

This PEP has no foreseen security implications: the ``License-Expression``
field is a plain string and the ``License-File`` fields are file paths.
Neither introduces any known new security concerns.


.. _639-how-to-teach-this:

How to Teach This
=================

A majority of packages use a single license which makes the case simple:
a single license identifier is a valid license expression.

Users of packaging tools will learn the valid license expression of their
package through the messages issued by the tools when they detect invalid
ones, or when the deprecated ``License`` field or license classifiers are used.

If an invalid ``License-Expression`` is used, the users will not be able
to publish their package to PyPI and an error message will help them
understand they need to use SPDX identifiers.
It will be possible to generate a distribution with incorrect license metadata,
but not to publish one on PyPI or any other index server that enforces
``License-Expression`` validity.
For authors using the now-deprecated ``License`` field or license classifiers,
packaging tools may warn them and inform them of the replacement,
``License-Expression``.

Tools may also help with the conversion and suggest a license expression in
many common cases:

- The appendix :ref:`639-spec-mapping-classifiers-identifiers` provides
  tool authors with recommendation on how to suggest a license expression
  produced from legacy classifiers.

- Tools may be able to suggest how to update an existing ``License`` value
  in project source metadata and convert that to a license expression,
  as also :ref:`specified in this PEP <639-spec-converting-metadata>`.

.. _639-reference-implementation:

Reference Implementation
========================

Tools will need to support parsing and validating license expressions in the
``License-Expression`` field if they decide to implement this part of the
specification.
It's up to the tools whether they prefer to implement the validation on their
side (e.g. like `hatch <hatchparseimpl_>`__) or use one of the available
Python libraries (e.g. `license-expression <licenseexplib_>`__).
This PEP does not mandate using any specific library and leaves it to the
tools authors to choose the best implementation for their projects.


.. _639-rejected-ideas:

Rejected Ideas
==============

Many alternative ideas were proposed and after a careful consideration,
rejected. The exhaustive list including the rationale for rejecting can be found
in a :ref:`separate page <639-rejected-ideas-details>`.


Appendices
