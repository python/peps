Abstract

    This PEP defines a standard for using the logging system (PEP 282
    [1]) in the standard library.

    Implementing this PEP will simplify development of daemon
    applications.  As a downside this PEP requires slight
    modifications (however in a back-portable way) to a large number
    of standard modules.

    After implementing this PEP one can use following filtering
    scheme:

        logging.getLogger('py.BaseHTTPServer').setLevel(logging.FATAL)

PEP Deferral

    Further exploration of the concepts covered in this PEP has been deferred
    for lack of a current champion interested in promoting the goals of the
    PEP and collecting and incorporating feedback, and with sufficient
    available time to do so effectively.


Rationale

    There are a couple of situations when output to stdout or stderr
    is impractical:

    - Daemon applications where the framework doesn't allow the
      redirection of standard output to some file, but assumes use of
      some other form of logging.  Examples are syslog under *nix'es
      and EventLog under WinNT+.

    - GUI applications which want to output every new log entry in
      separate pop-up window (i.e. fading OSD).

    Also sometimes applications want to filter output entries based on
    their source or severity.  This requirement can't be implemented
    using simple redirection.

    Finally sometimes output needs to be marked with event timestamps,
    which can be accomplished with ease using the logging system.


Proposal

    Every module usable for daemon and GUI applications should be
    rewritten to use the logging system instead of 'print' or
    'sys.stdout.write'.
    
    There should be code like this included in the beginning of every
    modified module:

        import logging

        _log = logging.getLogger('py.<module-name>')

    A prefix of 'py.' [2] must be used by all modules included in the
    standard library distributed along with Python, and only by such
    modules (unverifiable).  The use of "_log" is intentional as we
    don't want to auto-export it.  For modules that use log only in
    one class a logger can be created inside the class definition as
    follows:

        class XXX:

            __log = logging.getLogger('py.<module-name>')

    Then this class can create access methods to log to this private
    logger.

    So "print" and "sys.std{out|err}.write" statements should be
    replaced with "_log.{debug|info}", and "traceback.print_exception"
    with "_log.exception" or sometimes "_log.debug('...', exc_info=1)".


Module List

    Here is a (possibly incomplete) list of modules to be reworked:

    - asyncore (dispatcher.log, dispatcher.log_info)

    - BaseHTTPServer (BaseHTTPRequestHandler.log_request,
      BaseHTTPRequestHandler.log_error,
      BaseHTTPRequestHandler.log_message)

    - cgi (possibly - is cgi.log used by somebody?)

    - ftplib (if FTP.debugging)

    - gopherlib (get_directory)

    - httplib (HTTPResponse, HTTPConnection)

    - ihooks (_Verbose)

    - imaplib (IMAP4._mesg)

    - mhlib (MH.error)

    - nntplib (NNTP)

    - pipes (Template.makepipeline)

    - pkgutil (extend_path)

    - platform (_syscmd_ver)

    - poplib (if POP3._debugging)

    - profile (if Profile.verbose)

    - robotparser (_debug)

    - smtplib (if SGMLParser.verbose)

    - shlex (if shlex.debug)

    - smtpd (SMTPChannel/PureProxy where print >> DEBUGSTREAM)

    - smtplib (if SMTP.debuglevel)

    - SocketServer (BaseServer.handle_error)

    - telnetlib (if Telnet.debuglevel)

    - threading? (_Verbose._note, Thread.__bootstrap)

    - timeit (Timer.print_exc)

    - trace

    - uu (decode)

    Additionally there are a couple of modules with commented debug
    output or modules where debug output should be added.  For
    example:

    - urllib

    Finally possibly some modules should be extended to provide more
    debug information.


Doubtful Modules

    Listed here are modules that the community will propose for
    addition to the module list and modules that the community say
    should be removed from the module list.

Guidelines for Logging Usage

    Also we can provide some recommendation to authors of library
    modules so they all follow the same format of naming loggers.  I
    propose that non-standard library modules should use loggers named
    after their full names, so a module "spam" in sub-package "junk"
    of package "dummy" will be named "dummy.junk.spam" and, of course,
    the "__init__" module of the same sub-package will have the logger
    name "dummy.junk".
