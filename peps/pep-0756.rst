Abstract
========

Add functions to the limited C API version 3.14:

* ``PyUnicode_Export()``: export a Python str object as a ``Py_buffer``
  view.
* ``PyUnicode_Import()``: import a Python str object.

On CPython, ``PyUnicode_Export()`` has an *O*\ (1) complexity: no memory
is copied and no conversion is done.


Rationale
=========

PEP 393
-------

:pep:`393` "Flexible String Representation" changed string internals in
Python 3.3 to use three formats:

* ``PyUnicode_1BYTE_KIND``: Unicode range [U+0000; U+00ff],
  UCS-1, 1 byte/character.
* ``PyUnicode_2BYTE_KIND``: Unicode range [U+0000; U+ffff],
  UCS-2, 2 bytes/character.
* ``PyUnicode_4BYTE_KIND``: Unicode range [U+0000; U+10ffff],
  UCS-4, 4 bytes/character.

A Python ``str`` object must always use the most compact format. For
example, a string which only contains ASCII characters must use the
UCS-1 format.

The ``PyUnicode_KIND()`` function can be used to know the format used by
a string.

One of the following functions can be used to access data:

* ``PyUnicode_1BYTE_DATA()`` for ``PyUnicode_1BYTE_KIND``.
* ``PyUnicode_2BYTE_DATA()`` for ``PyUnicode_2BYTE_KIND``.
* ``PyUnicode_4BYTE_DATA()`` for ``PyUnicode_4BYTE_KIND``.

To get the best performance, a C extension should have 3 code paths for
each of these 3 string native formats.

Limited C API
-------------

:pep:`393` functions such as ``PyUnicode_KIND()`` and
``PyUnicode_1BYTE_DATA()`` are excluded from the limited C API. It's not
possible to write code specialized for UCS formats. A C extension using
the limited C API can only use less efficient code paths and string
formats.

For example, the `MarkupSafe project
<https://markupsafe.palletsprojects.com/>`_ has a C extension
specialized for UCS formats for best performance, and so cannot use the
limited C API.


Specification
=============

API
---

Add the following API to the limited C API version 3.14::

    int32_t PyUnicode_Export(
        PyObject *unicode,
        int32_t requested_formats,
        Py_buffer *view);
    PyObject* PyUnicode_Import(
        const void *data,
        Py_ssize_t nbytes,
        int32_t format);

    #define PyUnicode_FORMAT_UCS1  0x01   // Py_UCS1*
    #define PyUnicode_FORMAT_UCS2  0x02   // Py_UCS2*
    #define PyUnicode_FORMAT_UCS4  0x04   // Py_UCS4*
    #define PyUnicode_FORMAT_UTF8  0x08   // char*
    #define PyUnicode_FORMAT_ASCII 0x10   // char* (ASCII string)

The ``int32_t`` type is used instead of ``int`` to have a well defined
type size and not depend on the platform or the compiler.
See `Avoid C-specific Types
<https://github.com/capi-workgroup/api-evolution/issues/10>`_ for the
longer rationale.

PyUnicode_Export()
------------------

API::

    int32_t PyUnicode_Export(
        PyObject *unicode,
        int32_t requested_formats,
        Py_buffer *view)

Export the contents of the *unicode* string in one of the *requested_formats*.

* On success, fill *view*, and return a format (greater than ``0``).
* On error, set an exception, and return ``-1``.
  *view* is left unchanged.

After a successful call to ``PyUnicode_Export()``,
the *view* buffer must be released by ``PyBuffer_Release()``.
The contents of the buffer are valid until they are released.

The buffer is read-only and must not be modified.

The ``view->len`` member must be used to get the string length. The
buffer should end with a trailing NUL character, but it's not
recommended to rely on that because of embedded NUL characters.

*unicode* and *view* must not be NULL.

Available formats:

===================================  ========  ===========================
Constant Identifier                  Value     Description
===================================  ========  ===========================
``PyUnicode_FORMAT_UCS1``            ``0x01``  UCS-1 string (``Py_UCS1*``)
``PyUnicode_FORMAT_UCS2``            ``0x02``  UCS-2 string (``Py_UCS2*``)
``PyUnicode_FORMAT_UCS4``            ``0x04``  UCS-4 string (``Py_UCS4*``)
``PyUnicode_FORMAT_UTF8``            ``0x08``  UTF-8 string (``char*``)
``PyUnicode_FORMAT_ASCII``           ``0x10``  ASCII string (``Py_UCS1*``)
===================================  ========  ===========================

UCS-2 and UCS-4 use the native byte order.

*requested_formats* can be a single format or a bitwise combination of the
formats in the table above.
On success, the returned format will be set to a single one of the requested
formats.

Note that future versions of Python may introduce additional formats.

No memory is copied and no conversion is done.



.. _export-complexity:

Export complexity
-----------------

On CPython, an export has a complexity of *O*\ (1): no memory is copied
and no conversion is done.

To get the best performance on CPython and PyPy, it's recommended to
support these 4 formats::

    (PyUnicode_FORMAT_UCS1 \
     | PyUnicode_FORMAT_UCS2 \
     | PyUnicode_FORMAT_UCS4 \
     | PyUnicode_FORMAT_UTF8)

PyPy uses UTF-8 natively and so the ``PyUnicode_FORMAT_UTF8`` format is
recommended. It requires a memory copy, since PyPy ``str`` objects can
be moved in memory (PyPy uses a moving garbage collector).


Py_buffer format and item size
------------------------------

``Py_buffer`` uses the following format and item size depending on the
export format:

==========================  ==================  ============
Export format               Buffer format       Item size
==========================  ==================  ============
``PyUnicode_FORMAT_UCS1``   ``"B"``             1 byte
``PyUnicode_FORMAT_UCS2``   ``"=H"``            2 bytes
``PyUnicode_FORMAT_UCS4``   ``"=I"``            4 bytes
``PyUnicode_FORMAT_UTF8``   ``"B"``             1 byte
``PyUnicode_FORMAT_ASCII``  ``"B"``             1 byte
==========================  ==================  ============


PyUnicode_Import()
------------------

API::

    PyObject* PyUnicode_Import(
        const void *data,
        Py_ssize_t nbytes,
        int32_t format)

Create a Unicode string object from a buffer in a supported format.

* Return a reference to a new string object on success.
* Set an exception and return ``NULL`` on error.

*data* must not be NULL. *nbytes* must be positive or zero.

See ``PyUnicode_Export()`` for the available formats.


UTF-8 format
------------

CPython 3.14 doesn't use the UTF-8 format internally and doesn't support
exporting a string as UTF-8. The ``PyUnicode_AsUTF8AndSize()`` function
can be used instead.

The ``PyUnicode_FORMAT_UTF8`` format is provided for compatibility with
alternate implementations which may use UTF-8 natively for strings.


ASCII format
------------

When the ``PyUnicode_FORMAT_ASCII`` format is request for export, the
``PyUnicode_FORMAT_UCS1`` export format is used for ASCII strings.

The ``PyUnicode_FORMAT_ASCII`` format is mostly useful for
``PyUnicode_Import()`` to validate that a string only contains ASCII
characters.


Surrogate characters and embedded NUL characters
------------------------------------------------

Surrogate characters are allowed: they can be imported and exported.

Embedded NUL characters are allowed: they can be imported and exported.


Implementation
==============

Backwards Compatibility
=======================

There is no impact on the backward compatibility, only new C API
functions are added.


Usage of PEP 393 C APIs
=======================

there are many projects importing and exporting UCS formats with the
regular C API.

Rejected Ideas
==============

Reject embedded NUL characters and require trailing NUL character
-----------------------------------------------------------------

In C, it's convenient to have a trailing NUL character. For example,
the ``for (; *str != 0; str++)`` loop can be used to iterate on
characters and ``strlen()`` can be used to get a string length.

The problem is that a Python ``str`` object can embed NUL characters.
Example: ``"ab\0c"``. If a string contains an embedded NUL character,
code relying on the NUL character to find the string end truncates the
string. It can lead to bugs, or even security vulnerabilities.
See a previous discussion in the issue `Change PyUnicode_AsUTF8()
to return NULL on embedded null characters
<https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/111089>`_.

Rejecting embedded NUL characters require to scan the string which has
an *O*\ (*n*) complexity.


Reject surrogate characters
---------------------------

Surrogate characters are characters in the Unicode range [U+D800;
U+DFFF].  They are disallowed by UTF codecs such as UTF-8. A Python
``str`` object can contain arbitrary lone surrogate characters. Example:
``"\uDC80"``.

Rejecting surrogate characters prevents exporting a string which contains
such a character. It can be surprising and annoying since the
``PyUnicode_Export()`` caller doesn't control the string contents.

Allowing surrogate characters allows to export any string and so avoid
this issue. For example, the UTF-8 codec can be used with the
``surrogatepass`` error handler to encode and decode surrogate
characters.


Conversions on demand
---------------------

It would be convenient to convert formats on demand. For example,
convert UCS-1 and UCS-2 to UCS-4 if an export to only UCS-4 is
requested.

The problem is that most users expect an export to require no memory
copy and no conversion: an *O*\ (1) complexity. It is better to have an
API where all operations have an *O*\ (1) complexity.

Export to UTF-8
---------------

CPython 3.14 has a cache to encode a string to UTF-8. It is tempting to
allow exporting to UTF-8.

The problem is that the UTF-8 cache doesn't support surrogate
characters. An export is expected to provide the whole string content,
including embedded NUL characters and surrogate characters. To export
surrogate characters, a different code path using the ``surrogatepass``
error handler is needed and each export operation has to allocate a
temporary buffer: *O*\ (n) complexity.

An export is expected to have an *O*\ (1) complexity, so the idea to
export UTF-8 in CPython was abadonned.
