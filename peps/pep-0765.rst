Abstract
========

This PEP proposes to withdraw support for ``return``, ``break`` and
``continue`` statements that break out of a ``finally`` block.
This was proposed in the past by :pep:`601`. The current PEP
is based on empirical evidence regarding the cost/benefit of
this change, which did not exist at the time that :pep:`601`
was rejected. It also proposes a slightly different solution
than that which was proposed by :pep:`601`.

Motivation
==========

The semantics of ``return``, ``break`` and ``continue`` in a
finally block are surprising for many developers.
The :ref:`documentation <python:tut-cleanup>` mentions that:

- If the ``finally`` clause executes a ``break``, ``continue``
  or ``return`` statement, exceptions are not re-raised.

- If a ``finally`` clause includes a ``return`` statement, the
  returned value will be the one from the ``finally`` clause’s
  ``return`` statement, not the value from the ``try`` clause’s
  ``return`` statement.

Both of these behaviours cause confusion, but the first is
particularly dangerous because a swallowed exception is more
likely to slip through testing, than an incorrect return value.

In 2019, :pep:`601` proposed to change Python to emit a
``SyntaxWarning`` for a few releases and then turn it into a
``SyntaxError``. It was rejected in favour of viewing this
as a programming style issue, to be handled by linters and :pep:`8`.
Indeed, :pep:`8` now recommends not to use control flow statements
in a ``finally`` block, and linters such as
`Pylint <https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`__,
`Ruff <https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/>`__ and
`flake8-bugbear <https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8-bugbear>`__
flag them as a problem.

Rationale
=========

A recent `analysis of real world code
<https://github.com/iritkatriel/finally/blob/main/README.md>`_ shows that:

- These features are rare (2 per million LOC in the top 8,000 PyPI
  packages, 4 per million LOC in a random selection of packages).
  This could be thanks to the linters that flag this pattern.
- Most of the usages are incorrect, and introduce unintended
  exception-swallowing bugs.
- Code owners are typically receptive to fixing the bugs, and
  find that easy to do.

This new data indicates that it would benefit Python's users if
Python itself moved them away from this harmful feature.

One of the arguments brought up in `the PEP 601 discussion
<https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-601-forbid-return-break-continue-breaking-out-of-finally/2239/24>`__
was that language features should be orthogonal, and combine without
context-based restrictions. However, in the meantime :pep:`654` has
been implemented, and it forbids ``return``, ``break`` and ``continue``
in an ``except*`` clause because the semantics of that would violate
the property that ``except*`` clauses operate *in parallel*, so the
code of one clause should not suppress the invocation of another.
In that case we accepted that a combination of features can be
harmful enough that it makes sense to disallow it.


Specification
=============

The change is to specify as part of the language spec that
Python's compiler may emit a ``SyntaxWarning`` or ``SyntaxError``
when a ``return``, ``break`` or ``continue`` would transfer
control flow from within a ``finally`` block to a location outside
of it.

This includes the following examples:

.. code-block::
   :class: bad

    def f():
        try:
            ...
        finally:
            return 42

    for x in o:
        try:
            ...
        finally:
            break  # (or continue)

But excludes these:

.. code-block::
   :class: good

    try:
        ...
    finally:
        def f():
            return 42

    try:
        ...
    finally:
        for x in o:
            break  # (or continue)


CPython will emit a ``SyntaxWarning`` in version 3.14, and we leave
it open whether, and when, this will become a ``SyntaxError``.
However, we specify here that a ``SyntaxError`` is permitted by
the language spec, so that other Python implementations can choose
to implement that.

Backwards Compatibility
=======================

For backwards compatibility reasons, we are proposing that CPython
emit only a ``SyntaxWarning``, with no concrete plan to upgrade that
to an error. Code running with ``-We`` may stop working once this
is introduced.

Security Implications
=====================

The warning/error will help programmers avoid some hard to find bugs,
so will have a security benefit. We are not aware of security issues
related to raising a new ``SyntaxWarning`` or ``SyntaxError``.

How to Teach This
=================

The change will be documented in the language spec and in the
What's New documentation. The ``SyntaxWarning`` will alert users
that their code needs to change. The `empirical evidence
<https://github.com/iritkatriel/finally/blob/main/README.md>`__
shows that the changes necessary are typically quite
straightforward.

Rejected Ideas
==============

Emit `SyntaxError` in CPython
-----------------------------

:pep:`601` proposed that CPython would emit `SyntaxWarning` for a couple of
releases and `SyntaxError` afterwards. We are leaving it open whether, and
when, this will become a `SyntaxError` in CPython, because we believe that a
`SyntaxWarning` would give most of the benefit with less risk.

Change Semantics
----------------

It `was suggested <https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-765-disallow-return-break-continue-that-exit-a-finally-block/71348/32>`__
to change the semantics of control flow instruction in finally such that an
in-flight exception takes precedence over them.  In other words, a `return`,
`break` or `continue` would be permitted, and would exit the `finally` block,
but the exception would still be raised.

This was rejected for two reasons. First, it would change the semantics of
working code in a way that can be hard to debug: a `finally` that was written
with the intention of swallowing all exceptions (correctly using the documented
semantics) would now allow the exception to propagate on. This may happen only
in rare edge cases at runtime, and is not guaranteed to be detected in testing.
Even if the code is wrong, and has an exception swallowing bug, it could be
hard for users to understand why a program started raising exceptions in 3.14,
while it did not in 3.13.
In contrast, a `SyntaxError` is likely to be seen during testing, it would
point to the precise location of the problem in the code, and it would not
prevent the program from running.

The second objection was about the proposed semantics. The motivation for
allowing control flow statements is not that this would be useful, but rather
the desire for orthogonality of features (which, as we mentioned in the
introduction, is already violated in the case of `except*` clauses). However,
the proposed semantics are complicated because they suggest that `return`,
`break` and `continue` behave as they normally when finally is called without
an in-flight exception, but turn into something like a bare `raise` when there
is one. It is hard to claim that the features are orthogonal if the presence
of one changes the semantics of the other.
