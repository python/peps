Abstract

    This document describes the development and release schedule for
    Python 2.6 and 3.0.  The schedule primarily concerns itself with
    PEP-sized items.  Small features may be added up to and including
    the first beta release.  Bugs may be fixed until the final
    release.

    There will be at least two alpha releases, two beta releases, and
    one release candidate.  The releases are planned for October 2008.

    Python 2.6 is not only the next advancement in the Python 2
    series, it is also a transitional release, helping developers
    begin to prepare their code for Python 3.0.  As such, many
    features are being backported from Python 3.0 to 2.6.  Thus, it
    makes sense to release both versions in at the same time.  The
    precedence for this was set with the Python 1.6 and 2.0 release.

    Until rc, we will be releasing Python 2.6 and 3.0 in lockstep, on
    a monthly release cycle.  The releases will happen on the first
    Wednesday of every month through the beta testing cycle.  Because
    Python 2.6 is ready sooner, and because we have outside deadlines
    we'd like to meet, we've decided to split the rc releases.  Thus
    Python 2.6 final is currently planned to come out two weeks before
    Python 3.0 final.

Release Lifespan

    Python 3.0 is no longer being maintained for any purpose.

    Python 2.6.9 is the final security-only source-only maintenance
    release of the Python 2.6 series.  With its release on October 29,

    Warnings for features removed in Py3k:

        - builtins: apply, callable, coerce, dict.has_key, execfile,
          reduce, reload
        - backticks and <>
        - float args to xrange

Possible features for 2.6

    New features *should* be implemented prior to alpha2, particularly
    any C modifications or behavioral changes.  New features *must* be
    implemented prior to beta1 or will require Release Manager approval.

    The following PEPs are being worked on for inclusion in 2.6: None.

    Each non-trivial feature listed here that is not a PEP must be
    discussed on python-dev.  Other enhancements include:

        - distutils replacement (requires a PEP)

    New modules in the standard library:

        - winerror
          http://python.org/sf/1505257
          (Patch rejected, module should be written in C)

        - setuptools
          BDFL pronouncement for inclusion in 2.5:
          http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2006-April/063964.html

          PJE's withdrawal from 2.5 for inclusion in 2.6:
          http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2006-April/064145.html

    Modules to gain a DeprecationWarning (as specified for Python 2.6
    or through negligence):

        - rfc822
        - mimetools
        - multifile
        - compiler package (or a Py3K warning instead?)

    - Convert Parser/*.c to use the C warnings module rather than printf

    - Add warnings for Py3k features removed:
      * __getslice__/__setslice__/__delslice__
      * float args to PyArgs_ParseTuple
      * __cmp__?
      * other comparison changes?
      * int division?
      * All PendingDeprecationWarnings (e.g. exceptions)
      * using zip() result as a list
      * the exec statement (use function syntax)
      * function attributes that start with func_* (should use __*__)
      * the L suffix for long literals
      * renaming of __nonzero__ to __bool__
      * multiple inheritance with classic classes? (MRO might change)
      * properties and classic classes? (instance attrs shadow property)

    - use __bool__ method if available and there's no __nonzero__

    - Check the various bits of code in Demo/ and Tools/ all still work,
      update or remove the ones that don't.

    - All modules in Modules/ should be updated to be ssize_t clean.

    - All of Python (including Modules/) should compile cleanly with g++

    - Start removing deprecated features and generally moving towards Py3k

    - Replace all old style tests (operate on import) with unittest or docttest

    - Add tests for all untested modules

    - Document undocumented modules/features

    - bdist_deb in distutils package
      http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2006-February/060926.html

    - bdist_egg in distutils package

    - pure python pgen module
      (Owner: Guido)
      Deferral to 2.6:
      http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2006-April/064528.html

    - Remove the fpectl module?


Deferred until 2.7

    None
