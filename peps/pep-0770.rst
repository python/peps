Abstract
========

Almost all Python packages today are accurately measurable by software
composition analysis (SCA) tools. For projects that are not accurately
measurable, there is no existing mechanism to annotate a Python package
with composition data to improve measurability.

Software Bill-of-Materials (SBOM) is a technology-and-ecosystem-agnostic
method for describing software composition, provenance, heritage, and more.
SBOMs are used as inputs for SCA tools, such as scanners for vulnerabilities and
licenses, and have been gaining traction in global software regulations and
frameworks.

This PEP proposes using SBOM documents included in Python packages as a
means to improve automated software measurability for Python packages.

The changes will update the
`Core Metadata specification <coremetadataspec_>`__ to version 2.5.

Motivation
==========

Measurability and Phantom Dependencies
--------------------------------------

Python packages are particularly affected by the "`phantom dependency`_"
problem, where software components that aren't written in Python are included
in Python packages for many reasons, such as ease of installation and
compatibility with standards:

* Python serves scientific, data, web, and machine-learning use-cases which
  use compiled or non-Python languages like Rust, C, C++, Fortran, JavaScript,
  and others.
* The Python wheel format is preferred by users due to the ease-of-installation.
  No code is executed during the installation step, only extracting the archive.
* The Python wheel format requires bundling shared compiled libraries without
  a method to encode metadata about these libraries.
* Packages related to Python packaging sometimes need to solve the
  "bootstrapping" problem, so include pure Python projects inside their
  source code.

These software components can't be described using Python package metadata and
thus are likely to be missed by software composition analysis (SCA) software
which can mean vulnerable software components aren't reported accurately.

`For example <https://sethmlarson.dev/early-promising-results-with-sboms-and-python-packages>`__,
the Python package Pillow includes 16 shared object libraries in the wheel that
were bundled by auditwheel as a part of the build. None of those shared object
libraries are detected when using common SCA tools like Syft and Grype.
If an SBOM document is included annotating all the included shared libraries
then SCA tools can identify the included software reliably.

Build Tools, Environment, and Reproducibility
---------------------------------------------

Going beyond the runtime dependencies of a package: SBOMs can also record the
tools and environments used to build a package. Recording the exact tools
and versions used to build a package is often required to establish
`build reproducibility <https://reproducible-builds.org>`__.
Build reproducibility is a property of software that can be used to detect
incorrectly or maliciously modified software components when compared to their
upstream sources. Without a recorded list of build tools and versions it can
become difficult to impossible for a third-party to verify build reproducibility.

Regulations
-----------

SBOMs are required by recent software security regulations, like the
`Secure Software Development Framework`_ (SSDF) and the
`Cyber Resilience Act`_ (CRA). Due to their inclusion in these regulations,
the demand for SBOM documents of open source projects is expected to be high.
One goal is to minimize the demands on open source project maintainers by
enabling open source users that need SBOMs to self-serve using existing
tooling.

Another goal is to enable contributions from users who need SBOMs to annotate
projects they depend on with SBOM information. Today there is no mechanism to
propagate the results of those contributions for a Python package so there is
no incentive for users to contribute this type of work.

Rationale
=========

Using SBOM standards instead of Core Metadata fields
----------------------------------------------------

Attempting to add every field offered by SBOM standards into Python package
Core Metadata would result in an explosion of new Core Metadata fields,
including the need to keep up-to-date as SBOM standards continue to evolve
to suit new needs in that space.

Instead, this proposal delegates SBOM-specific metadata to SBOM documents that
are included in Python packages and adds a new Core Metadata field for
discoverability of included SBOM documents.

This standard also doesn't aim to replace Core Metadata with SBOMs,
instead focusing on the SBOM information being supplemental to Core Metadata.
Included SBOMs only contain information about dependencies included in the
package archive or information about the top-level software in the package that
can't be encoded into Core Metadata but is relevant for the SBOM use-case
("software identifiers", "purpose", "support level", etc).

Zero-or-more opaque SBOM documents
----------------------------------

Rather than requiring at most one included SBOM document per Python package,
this PEP proposes that one or more SBOM documents may be included in a Python
package. This means that code attempting to annotate a Python package with SBOM
data may do so without being concerned about corrupting data already contained
within other SBOM documents.

Additionally, this PEP treats SBOM document data opaquely instead relying on
final end-users of the SBOM data to process the contained SBOM data.
This choice acknowledges that SBOM standards are an active area of development
where there is not yet (and may never be) a single definitive SBOM standard
and that SBOM standards can continue to evolve independent of Python packaging
standards. Already tools that consume SBOM documents support a multitude of
SBOM standards to handle this reality.

These decisions mean this PEP is capable of supporting any SBOM standard
and does not favor one over the other, instead deferring the decision to
producing projects and tools and consuming user tooling.

.. _770-spec:

Specification
=============

The changes necessary to implement this PEP include:

* Additions to `Core Metadata <770-spec-core-metadata_>`_, as defined in the
  `Core Metadata specification <coremetadataspec_>`__.
* Additions to the author-provided
  `project source metadata <770-spec-project-source-metadata_>`_, as defined in the
  `pyproject.toml specification <pyprojecttoml_>`__.
* `Additions <770-spec-project-formats_>`_ to the source distribution (sdist),
  built distribution (wheel), and installed project specifications.

In addition to the above, an informational PEP will be created for tools
consuming included SBOM documents and other Python package metadata to
generate complete SBOM documents for Python packages.

Terminology
-----------

This section describes terminology used later in the document:

.. glossary::

    root SBOM directory
        The directory under which SBOM files are stored in a
        :term:`project source tree`, :term:`distribution archive`
        or :term:`installed project`.
        Also, the root directory that their paths
        recorded in the :ref:`Sbom-File <770-spec-sbom-file-field>`
        :term:`Core Metadata field` are relative to.
        Defined to be the :term:`project root directory`
        for a :term:`project source tree` or
        :term:`source distribution <Source Distribution (or "sdist")>`;
        and a subdirectory named ``sboms`` of
        the directory containing the :term:`built metadata`—
        i.e., the ``.dist-info/sboms`` directory—
        for a :term:`Built Distribution` or :term:`installed project`.

.. _770-spec-core-metadata:

Core Metadata
-------------

.. _770-spec-sbom-file-field:

Add ``Sbom-File`` field
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``Sbom-File`` is a new optional Core Metadata field. Each instance contains a
string representation of the path to an SBOM document. The path is specified
relative to the :term:`root SBOM directory` for all project types. It is a
multi-use field that MAY appear zero or more times and each instance lists the
path to one such file. Files specified under this field are SBOM documents
that are distributed with the package.

As `specified by this PEP <#770-spec-project-formats>`__, its value is also
that file's path relative to the :term:`root SBOM directory` in both installed
projects and the standardized Distribution Package types.

If an ``Sbom-File`` is listed in a
:term:`Source Distribution <Source Distribution (or "sdist")>` or
:term:`Built Distribution`'s Core Metadata:

* That file MUST be included in the :term:`distribution archive` at the
  specified path relative to the :term:`root SBOM directory`.
* Installers MUST install the file with the :term:`project` at that same
  relative path.
* Inside the :term:`root SBOM directory`, packaging tools MUST reproduce the
  directory structure under which the source files are located relative to the
  project root.
* Path delimiters MUST be the forward slash character (``/``), and parent
  directory indicators (``..``) MUST NOT be used.

For all newly-uploaded distribution archives that include one or more
``Sbom-File`` fields in their Core Metadata and declare a ``Metadata-Version``
of ``2.5`` or higher, PyPI and other indices SHOULD validate that all files
specified with ``Sbom-File`` are present in the distribution archives.

.. _770-spec-project-source-metadata:

Project source metadata
-----------------------

This PEP specifies changes to the project's source metadata under a
``[project]`` table in the ``pyproject.toml`` file.

Add ``sbom-files`` key
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A new optional ``sbom-files`` key is added to the ``[project]`` table for
specifying paths in the project source tree relative to ``pyproject.toml`` to
file(s) containing SBOMs to be distributed with the package. This key
corresponds to the ``Sbom-File`` fields in the Core Metadata.

Its value is an array of strings which MUST contain valid glob patterns, as
specified below:

* Alphanumeric characters, underscores (``_``), hyphens (``-``) and dots (``.``)
  MUST be matched verbatim.
* Special glob characters: ``*``, ``?``, ``**`` and character ranges: ``[]``
  containing only the verbatim matched characters MUST be supported. Within
  ``[...]``, the hyphen indicates a locale-agnostic range (e.g. a-z, order based
  on Unicode code points). Hyphens at the start or end are matched literally.
* Path delimiters MUST be the forward slash character (``/``). Patterns are
  relative to the directory containing ``pyproject.toml``, therefore the leading
  slash character MUST NOT be used.
* Parent directory indicators (``..``) MUST NOT be used.

Any characters or character sequences not covered by this specification are
invalid. Projects MUST NOT use such values. Tools consuming this field SHOULD
reject invalid values with an error.

Literal paths (e.g. ``bom.cdx.json``) are treated as valid globs which means
they can also be defined.

Build tools:

* MUST treat each value as a glob pattern, and MUST raise an error if the
  pattern contains invalid glob syntax.
* MUST include all files matched by a listed pattern in all distribution
  archives.
* MUST list each matched file path under an ``Sbom-File`` field in the
  Core Metadata.
* MUST raise an error if any individual user-specified pattern does not match
  at least one file.

If the ``sbom-files`` key is present and is set to a value of an empty array,
then tools MUST NOT include any SBOM files and MUST NOT raise an error.

Examples of valid SBOM files declarations:

.. code-block:: toml

    [project]
    sbom-files = ["bom.json"]

    [project]
    sbom-files = ["sboms/openssl.cdx.json", "sboms/openssl.spdx.json"]

    [project]
    sbom-files = ["sboms/*"]

    [project]
    sbom-files = []

Examples of invalid SBOM files declarations:

.. code-block:: toml

    [project]
    sbom-files = ["..\bom.json"]

Reason: ``..`` must not be used. ``\\`` is an invalid path delimiter, ``/``
must be used.

.. code-block:: toml

    [project]
    sbom-files = ["bom{.json*"]

Reason: ``bom{.json`` is not a valid glob.

.. _770-spec-project-formats:

SBOM files in project formats
-----------------------------

A few additions will be made to the existing specifications.

:term:`Project source trees <Project source tree>`
  Per :ref:`639-spec-source-metadata` section, the
  `Declaring Project Metadata specification <pyprojecttoml_>`__
  will be updated to reflect that SBOM file paths MUST be relative to the
  project root directory; i.e. the directory containing the ``pyproject.toml``
  (or equivalently, other legacy project configuration,
  e.g. ``setup.py``, ``setup.cfg``, etc).

:term:`Source distributions (sdists) <Source Distribution (or "sdist")>`
  The sdist specification will be updated to reflect that if the
  ``Metadata-Version`` is ``2.5`` or greater, the sdist MUST contain any SBOM
  files specified by the ``Sbom-File`` field in the ``PKG-INFO`` at their
  respective paths relative to the sdist (containing the ``pyproject.toml`` and
  the ``PKG-INFO`` Core Metadata).

:term:`Built distributions <Built distribution>` (:term:`wheels <wheel>`)
  The wheel specification will be updated to reflect that if the
  ``Metadata-Version`` is ``2.5`` or greater and one or more ``Sbom-File``
  fields are specified, the ``.dist-info`` directory MUST contain an ``sboms``
  subdirectory, which MUST contain the files listed in the ``Sbom-File`` fields
  in the ``METADATA`` file at their respective paths relative to the ``sboms``
  directory.

:term:`Installed projects <Installed project>`
  The Recording Installed Projects specification will be updated to reflect that
  if the ``Metadata-Version`` is ``2.5`` or greater and one or more
  ``Sbom-File`` fields is specified, the ``.dist-info`` directory MUST contain
  an ``sboms`` subdirectory which MUST contain the files listed in the
  ``Sbom-File`` fields in the ``METADATA`` file at their respective paths
  relative to the ``sboms`` directory, and that any files in this directory MUST
  be copied from wheels by install tools.

SBOM data interoperability
--------------------------

This PEP treats data contained within SBOM documents as opaque, recognizing
that SBOM standards are an active area of development. However, there are some
considerations for SBOM data producers that when followed will improve the
interoperability and usability of SBOM data made available in Python packages:

* SBOM documents SHOULD use a widely-accepted SBOM standard, such as
  `CycloneDX <cyclonedxspec_>`_ or `SPDX <spdxspec_>`_.
* SBOM documents SHOULD use UTF-8-encoded JSON (:rfc:`8259`) when available
  for the SBOM standard in use.
* SBOM documents SHOULD include all required fields for the SBOM standard in
  use.
* SBOM documents SHOULD include a "time of creation" and "creating tool" field
  for the SBOM standard in use. This information is important for users
  attempting to reconstruct different stages for a Python package being built.
* The primary component described by the SBOM document SHOULD be the top-level
  software within the Python package (for example,
  "pkg:pypi/pillow" for the Pillow package).
* All non-primary components SHOULD have one or more paths in the relationship
  graph showing the relationship between components. If this information isn't
  included, SCA tools might exclude components outside of the relationship graph.
* All software components SHOULD have a name, version, and one or more software
  identifiers (PURL, CPE, download URL).

PyPI and other indices MAY validate the contents of SBOM documents specified by
this PEP, but MUST NOT validate or reject data for unknown
SBOM standards, versions, or fields.

Backwards Compatibility
=======================

There are no backwards compatibility concerns for this PEP.

The changes to Python package Core Metadata and ``pyproject.toml`` are
only additive, this PEP doesn't change the behavior of any existing fields.

Tools which are processing Python packages can use the ``Sbom-File`` core
metadata field to clearly delineate between packages which include SBOM
documents that implement this PEP (and thus have more requirements) and
packages which include SBOM documents before this PEP was authored.

Security Implications
=====================

SBOM documents are only as useful as the information encoded in them.
If an SBOM document contains incorrect information then this can result in
incorrect downstream analysis by SCA tools. For this reason, it's important
for tools including SBOM data into Python packages to be confident in the
information they are recording. SBOMs are capable of recording "known unknowns"
in addition to known data. This practice is recommended when not certain about
the data being recorded to allow for further analysis by users.

Because SBOM documents can encode information about the original system
where a Python package is built (for example, the operating system name and
version, less commonly the names of paths). This information has the potential
to "leak" through the Python package to installers via SBOMs. If this
information is sensitive, then that could represent a security risk.

How to Teach This
=================

Most typical users of Python and Python packages won't need to know the details
of this standard. The details of this standard are most important to either
maintainers of Python packages and developers of SCA tools such as
SBOM generation tools and vulnerability scanners.

What do Python package maintainers need to know?
------------------------------------------------

Python package metadata can already describe the top-level software included in
a package archive, but what if a package archive contains other software
components beyond the top-level software? For example, the Python wheel for
"Pillow" contains a handful of other software libraries bundled inside, like
``libjpeg``, ``libpng``, ``libwebp``, and so on. This scenario is where this PEP
is most useful, for adding metadata about bundled software to a Python package.

Some build tools may be able to automatically annotate bundled dependencies.
Typically tools can automatically annotate bundled dependencies when those
dependencies come from a "packaging ecosystem" (such as PyPI, Linux distros,
Crates.io, NPM, etc).

For packages which cannot be automatically annotated and if the package author
wishes to provide an SBOM the approach will be to generate or author SBOM files
and then include those files using ``pyproject.toml``:

 .. code-block:: toml

    [project]
    ...
    sbom-files = [
        "sboms/bom.cdx.json"
    ]

For projects manually specifying an SBOM document the challenge will be
keeping the document up-to-date. The CPython project has some
`customized tooling <https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Tools/build/generate_sbom.py>`__
for this task, but it can likely be generalized into a tool reusable by other
projects.

What do SBOM tool authors need to know?
---------------------------------------

Developers of SBOM generation tooling will need to know about the existence
of this PEP and that Python packages may begin publishing SBOM documents
within package archives. This information needs to be included as a part of
generating an SBOM document for a particular Python package or Python
environment.

A follow-up informational PEP will be authored to describe how to transform
Python packaging metadata, including the mechanism described in this PEP,
into an SBOM document describing Python packages. Once the informational PEP is
complete, tracking issues will be opened specifically linking to the
informational PEP to spur the adoption of PEP 770 by SBOM tools.

A `benchmark is being created <https://github.com/psf/sboms-for-python-packages/tree/main/benchmark>`__
to compare the outputs of different SBOM tools when run with various Python
packaging inputs (package archive, installed package, environment, container
image) is being created to track the progress of different SBOM generation
tools. This benchmark will inform where tools have gaps in support
of this PEP and Python packages.

What do users of SBOM documents need to know?
---------------------------------------------

Many users of this PEP won't know of its existence, instead their software
composition analysis tools, SBOM tools, or vulnerability scanners will simply
begin giving more comprehensive information after an upgrade. For users that are
interested in the sources of this new information, the "tool" field of SBOM
metadata already provides linkages to the projects generating their SBOMs.

For users who need SBOM documents describing their open source dependencies the
first step should always be "create them yourself". Using the benchmarks above
a list of tools that are known to be accurate for Python packages can be
documented and recommended to users. For projects which require
additional manual SBOM annotation: tips for contributing this data and tools for
maintaining the data can be recommended.

Reference Implementation
========================

`Auditwheel fork <https://sethmlarson.dev/early-promising-results-with-sboms-and-python-packages>`_
which generates CycloneDX SBOM documents to include in wheels describing
bundled shared library files. These SBOM documents worked as expected for the
Syft and Grype SBOM and vulnerability scanners.

Rejected Ideas
==============

Why not require a single SBOM standard?
---------------------------------------

Most discussion and development around SBOMs today focuses on two SBOM
standards: `CycloneDX <cyclonedxspec_>`_ and `SPDX <spdxspec_>`_. There is no clear
"winner" between these two standards, both standards are frequently used by
projects and software ecosystems.

Because both standards are frequently used, tools for consuming and processing
SBOM documents commonly need to support both standards. This means that this PEP
is not constrained to select a single SBOM standard by its consumers and thus
can allow tools creating SBOM documents for inclusion in Python packages to
choose which SBOM standard works best for their use-case.

Rejected Ideas
==============

Selecting a single SBOM standard
--------------------------------

There is no universally accepted SBOM standard and this area is still
rapidly evolving (for example, SPDX released a new major version of their
standard in April 2024). To avoid locking the Python ecosystem into a specific
standard ahead of when a clear winner emerges this PEP treats SBOM documents
as opaque and only makes recommendations to promote compatibility with
downstream consumers of SBOM document data.

None of the decisions in this PEP restrict a future PEP to select
a single SBOM standard. Tools that use SBOM data today already need to support
multiple formats to handle this situation, so a future standard that updates to
require only one standard would have no effect on downstream SBOM tools.

Open Issues
===========

Conditional project source SBOM files
-------------------------------------

How can a project specify an SBOM file that is conditional? Under what
circumstances would an SBOM document be conditional?
