Abstract
========

Add a new variant of the Stable ABI, called “Stable ABI for Free-Threaded
Python” (or ``abi3t`` for short), and a corresponding API limitations.

``abi3t`` will be based on the existing Stable ABI (``abi3``), but make the
:c:type:`PyObject` structure opaque.
This will require users to migrate to new API for common tasks like defining
modules and most classes.

At least initially, extensions built for ``abi3t`` will be compatible with
the existing Stable ABI (``abi3``).


Terminology
===========

This PEP uses “GIL-enabled build” as an antonym to “free-threaded build”,
that is, an interpreter or extension built without ``Py_GIL_DISABLED``.


Motivation
==========

The Stable ABI is currently not available for free-threaded builds.
Extensions will fail to build for a both Limited API and
free-threaded Python (that is, when both :c:macro:`Py_LIMITED_API` and
:c:macro:`Py_GIL_DISABLED` preprocessor macros are defined).
Extensions built for GIL-enabled builds of CPython will fail to load
(or crash) on free-threaded builds.

In its `acceptance post <https://discuss.python.org/t/84319/123>`__
for :pep:`779`, the Steering Council stated that it “expects that Stable ABI
for free-threading should be prepared and defined for Python 3.15”.

This PEP proposes the Stable ABI for free-threading.


Background
----------

Python's Stable ABI (``abi3`` for short), as defined in :pep:`384` and
:pep:`652`, provides a way to compile extension modules that can be loaded
on multiple minor versions of the CPython interpreter.
Several projects use this to limit the number of
:ref:`wheels <packaging:binary-distribution-format>` (binary artefacts)
that need to be built and distributed for each release, and/or to make it
easier to test with pre-release versions of Python.

With free-threading builds (:pep:`703`) being on track to eventually become
the default (:pep:`779`), we need a way to make a Stable ABI available
to those builds.

To build against a Stable ABI, the extension must use a *Limited API*,
that is, only a subset of the functions, structures, etc. that CPython
exposes.
Both the Limited API and the current Stable ABI are versioned, and building
against Stable ABI 3.X requires using only Limited API 3.X, and yields an
extension that is ABI-compatible with CPython 3.X and *any* later version
(though bugs in CPython sometimes cause incompatibilities in practice).

The Limited API is not “stable”: newer versions may remove API that
were a part of older versions.

This PEP proposes additional API limitations, as required to be compatible
with both GIL-enabled and free-threaded builds of CPython.


Rationale
=========

The design in this PEP uses several constraints:

Separate ABI
   The new ABI (``abi3t``) will conceptually be treated as separate from the
   existing Stable ABI (``abi3``).

   However, it will be possible to compile a single extension module that
   supports both free-threaded and GIL-enabled builds.
   This should involve no additional limitations, at least in the initial
   implementation, and so it will be preferred over building
   ``abi3t``-only extensions.

No backwards compatibility now
   The new stable ABI variant will not support CPython 3.14 and below.
   Projects that need this support can build separate extensions specifically
   for the 3.14 free-threaded interpreter, and for older stable ABI versions.

   However, we won't block the possibility of extending compatibility to
   CPython 3.14 and below, and we recommend that package installation tools
   prepare for such extensions.
   See a :ref:`rejected idea <pep803-no-shim>` for how this could work.

API changes are OK
   The new Limited API variant may require extension authors to make
   significant changes to their code.
   Projects that cannot do this (yet) can continue using the existing Limited
   API, and compile separately for GIL-enabled builds
   and for specific versions of free-threaded builds.


Tag name
--------

The tag ``abi3t`` is chosen to reflect the fact that this ABI is similar to
``abi3``, with minimal changes necessary to support free-threading (which
uses the letter ``t`` in existing, version-specific ABI tags like ``cp314t``).


Specification
=============


Stable ABI for free-threaded builds
-----------------------------------

Python will introduce a new stable ABI, called *stable ABI for free-threading
builds*, or ``abi3t`` for short.
As with the current Stable ABI (``abi3``), ``abi3t`` will be versioned
using major (3) and minor versions of Python interpreter.
Extensions built for ``abi3t`` :samp:`3.{x}` will be compatible with
CPython :samp:`3.{x}` and above.

To build a C/C++ extension for ``abi3t``, the extension will need to only
use *limited API for free-threaded builds*.
Like the existing Limited API, this will be a subset of the general CPython
C API.
Initially, it will also be a subset of the Limited API.
We will strive to keep it as a subset, but will not guarantee this.

Since ``abi3t`` and ``abi3`` will overlap, it will be possible for a single
compiled extension to support both at once, and thus be compatible with
CPython 3.15+ (both free-threaded and GIL-eanbled builds).
Initially, any extension compiled for ``abi3t`` will be compatible with
``abi3`` as well.


Choosing the target ABI
-----------------------

Users of the C API -- or build tools acting on their behalf, configured by
tool-specific UI -- will select the target ABI using the following macros:

* ``Py_LIMITED_API=<version>`` (existing):
  Compile for ``abi3`` of the given version.
* ``Py_TARGET_ABI3T=<version>`` (proposed here):
  Compile for ``abi3t`` of the given version.

These two macros are functionally very similar.
In hindsight, ``Py_TARGET_ABI3`` (without the ``T``) would be a more fitting
name for :c:macro:`Py_LIMITED_API`.
We keep the existing name for backwards compatibility.

For ease of use and implementation simplicity, respectively, ``Python.h`` will
set the configuration macros automatically in the following situations:

* If :samp:`Py_LIMITED_API={v}` and ``Py_GIL_DISABLED`` is set, then
  ``Py_TARGET_ABI3T`` will be defined as :samp:`{v}` by default.
  (This allows choosing ``abi3t`` by defining the pre-existing macro and
  compiling with free-threaded CPython headers. Note that in CPython 3.14,
  this case results in a compile-time error.)

* If :samp:`Py_TARGET_ABI3T={v}` is set, CPython *may* define or redefine
  ``Py_LIMITED_API`` as :samp:`{v}`.
  (This means that CPython can continue to use the ``Py_LIMITED_API`` macro
  internally to select which APIs are available.)


Opaque PyObject
---------------

``abi3t`` will initially have a single diffenerce from ``abi3``: the
``PyObject`` structure and APIs that depend on it are not part of ``abi3t``.

Specifically, when building for ``abi3t``, the CPython headers will:

- make the following structures *opaque* (or in C terminology, *incomplete
  types*):

  - :c:type:`PyObject`
  - :c:type:`PyVarObject`
  - :c:type:`!PyModuleDef_Base`
  - :c:type:`PyModuleDef`

- no longer include the following macros:

  - :c:macro:`PyObject_HEAD`
  - :c:macro:`!_PyObject_EXTRA_INIT`
  - :c:macro:`PyObject_HEAD_INIT`
  - :c:macro:`PyObject_VAR_HEAD`
  - :c:func:`Py_SET_TYPE`

In both the regular stable ABI (``abit3`` 3.15+) and the new
``abi3t``, the following will be exported functions (exposed in the ABI)
rather than macros:

- :c:func:`Py_SIZE`
- :c:func:`Py_SET_SIZE`


Implications
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Making the ``PyObject``, ``PyVarObject`` and ``PyModuleDef`` structures
opaque means:

- Their fields may not be directly accessed.

  For example, instead of ``o->ob_type``, extensions must use
  ``Py_TYPE(o)``.
  This usage has been the preferred practice for some time.

- Their size and alignment will not be available.
  Expressions such as ``sizeof(PyObject)`` will no longer work.

- They cannot be embedded in other structures.
  This mainly affects instance structs of extension-defined types,
  which will need to be defined using API added in :pep:`697` -- that is,
  using a ``struct`` *without* ``PyObject`` (or other base class struct) at
  the beginning, with :c:func:`PyObject_GetTypeData` calls needed to access
  the memory.

- Variables of these types cannot be created.
  This mainly affects static ``PyModuleDef`` variables needed to define
  extension modules.
  Virtually all extensions will need to switch the new export hook
  added in :pep:`793` (:c:func:`PyModExport_modulename`) to support ``abi3t``.

The following functions will become practically unusable in ``abi3t``,
since an extension cannot create valid, statically allocated, input
for them.
They will, however, not be removed.

- :c:func:`PyModuleDef_Init`
- :c:func:`PyModule_Create`, :c:func:`PyModule_Create2`
- :c:func:`PyModule_FromDefAndSpec`, :c:func:`PyModule_FromDefAndSpec2`


Runtime ABI checks
------------------

Users -- or rather build/install tools acting on users' behalf --
will continue to be responsible for not putting incompatible extensions on
Python's import paths.
This decision makes sense since tools typically have much richer metadata than
what CPython can check.
Typically, build tools and installers use `PyPA packaging metadata`_ and
`platform compatibility tags`_ to communicate compatibility details, but other
models are possible.

.. _PyPA packaging metadata: https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/core-metadata/
.. _platform compatibility tags: https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/platform-compatibility-tags/

However, CPython will add a line of defense against outdated or misconfigured
tools, or human mistakes, in the form of a new *module slot* containing
basic ABI information.
This information will be checked when a module is loaded, and incompatible
extensions will be rejected.
The specifics are left to the C API working group
(see `issue 72 <https://github.com/capi-workgroup/decisions/issues/72>`__).

This slot will become *mandatory* with the new export hook added in
:pep:`793`.
(That PEP currently says “there are no required slots”; it will be updated.)


Check for non-free-threaded ABI in free-threading builds
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Additionally, in free-threaded builds, :c:func:`PyModuleDef_Init` will detect
extensions using the non-free-threading Stable ABI, emit an informative
message when one is loaded, *and* raise an exception.
(Implementation note: A message will be printed before raising the exception,
because extensions that attempt to handle an exception using incompatible ABI
will likely crash and lose the exception's message.)

This check for non-free-threading ``abi3`` relies on internal bit patterns
and may be removed in future CPython versions,
if the internal object layout needs to change.


The ``abi3t`` wheel tag
-----------------------

Wheels that use a stable ABI compatible with free-threading CPython builds
should use a new `ABI tag`_: ``abi3t``.

.. _ABI tag: https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/platform-compatibility-tags/#abi-tag

Recommendations for installers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Package installers should treat this tag as completely separate from ``abi3``.
They should allow ``abi3t``-tagged wheels for free-threaded builds wherever
they currently allow ``abi3``-tagged ones for (orherwise equal)
non-free-threaded builds.

Recommendations for build tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Build tools should give users one or two additional options, in addition to
the existing CPython version-specific ABI (:samp:`cp3{nn}`) and
Stable ABI (``abi3``):

- Compile extensions compatible with *both* ``abi3`` and ``abi3t``, by either:

  - defining both :samp:`Py_LIMITED_API={v}` and :samp:`Py_TARGET_ABI3T={v}`, or
  - defining :samp:`Py_LIMITED_API={v}` and:

    - defining ``Py_GIL_DISABLED`` (on Windows)
    - building with free-threaded CPython headers (elsewhere)

  Such extensions should be tagged with the `compressed tag set`_
  ``abi3.abi3t``.

- Compile extensions compatible with *only* ``abi3t``, by defining only
  :samp:`Py_TARGET_ABI3T={v}` and tagging the result with ``abi3t``.
  This will initially offer no advantages over the ``abi3.abi3t`` option
  above, but there is a possibility that it will become useful in the future.

In the above, :samp:`{v}` stands for a the lowest Python version with which
the extension should be compatible, in :c:func:`Py_PACK_VERSION` format.
In the cases above, this version must be set to 3.15 or higher.

.. _compressed tag set: https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/platform-compatibility-tags/#compressed-tag-sets

The version of the Stable ABI, both ``abi3`` and ``abi3t``, is indicated by
the `Python wheel tag`_.
For example, a wheel tagged ``cp315-abi3.abi3t`` will be compatible with
3.15, 3.16, and later versions;
``cp317-abi3.abi3t`` will be compatible with 3.17+.

.. _Python wheel tag: https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/platform-compatibility-tags/#python-tag

Note that this PEP does not provide a way to target Stable ABI for
Free-threaded Python 3.14 and below (``cp314-abi3t``).
This may change an the future, or with experimental build tools, so
*installers* should be prepared for such extensions.


New API
-------

Implementing this PEP will make it possible to build extensions that
can be successfully loaded on free-threaded Python, but not necessarily ones
that are thread-safe without a GIL.

Limited API to allow thread-safety without a GIL -- presumably ``PyMutex``,
``PyCriticalSection``, and similar -- will be added via the C API working group,
or in a follow-up PEP.


Backwards and Forwards Compatibility
====================================

Extensions targetting ``abi3t`` will not be backwards-compatible with older
CPython releases, due to the need to use new ``PyModExport`` API added
in :pep:`793`.

Extension authors who cannot switch may continue to use the existing ``abi3``,
that is, build on GIL-enabled Python without defining ``Py_GIL_DISABLED``.
For compatibility with free-threaded builds, they can compile using
version-specific ABI -- that is, compile ``abi3``-compatible source
on free-threaded CPython builds without defining ``Py_LIMITED_API``.

Limited API 3.15 for free-threading is a subset of the existing Limited API,
and as such, it will be forward-compatible with future versions of CPython 3.x.
Older versions of the Limited API (that is, 3.14 and below) will continue
to be forward-compatible with GIL-enabled builds of CPython 3.x, starting with
the version that introduced the given Limited API.

In the “Compile on” column, *FT* means that the :c:macro:`Py_GIL_DISABLED`
macro must be defined -- either explicitly or, on non-Windows platforms,
by including CPython headers configured with :option:`--disable-gil`.
*GIL* means that :c:macro:`Py_GIL_DISABLED` must *not* be defined.

In the ``Py_LIMITED_API`` and ``Py_TARGET_ABI3T``, a dash means the macro
must not be defined; a version means the macro must be set to the corresponding
integer in :c:func:`Py_PACK_VERSION` format.

Values in the *Note* column:

* *existing*: The wheel tag is currently in use
* *continued*: The wheel tag continues the existing scheme
* *new*: Proposed in this PEP.
* *reserved*: A mechanism to build a matching extension is not proposed in
  this PEP, but may be added in the future.
  Installers should be prepared to handle the tag.

Security Implications
=====================

None known.


How to Teach This
=================

A porting guide will need to explain how to move to APIs added in
:pep:`697` (Limited C API for Extending Opaque Types)
and :pep:`793` (``PyModExport``).


Reference Implementation
========================

This PEP combines several pieces, implemented individually:

- Opaque ``PyObject`` is available in CPython main branch after defining the
  ``_Py_OPAQUE_PYOBJECT`` macro.
  Implemented in GitHub pull request `python/cpython#136505
  <https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/136505>`__.
- For ``PyModExport``, see :pep:`793` and
  `GitHub issue #140550 <https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/140550>`_.
- A version-checking slot was implemented in GitHub pull request
  `python/cpython#137212 <https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/137212>`__.
- A check for older ``abi3`` was implemented in GitHub pull request
  `python/cpython#137957 <https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/137957>`__.
- For wheel tags, there is no implementation yet.
- A porting guide is not yet written.


Rejected Ideas
==============


Make ``PyObject`` opaque in Limited API 3.15
--------------------------------------------

It would be possible to make ``PyObject`` struct opaque in Limited API 3.15
(that is, the new version of the existing Limited API),
rather than introduce a new variant of the Stable ABI and Limited API.

This would mean that extension authors would need to adapt their code to the
new limitations, or abandon Limited API altogether, in order to use any C API
introduced in Python 3.15.

It would also not remove the need for a new wheel tag (``abi3t``),
which would be required to express that an extension
is compatible with both GIL-enabled and free-threaded builds
of CPython 3.14 or lower.


.. _pep803-no-shim:

Shims for compatibility with CPython 3.14
-----------------------------------------

It’s possible to build a ``cp314-abi3.abi3t`` extension – one compatible
with 3.14 (both free-threaded build and default).
There are several challenges around this:

* making it convenient and safe for general extensions
* testing it (as CPython’s test suite doesn’t involve other CPython versions
  than the one being tested)

So, providing a mechanism to build such extensions is best suited to an
external project (for example, one like `pythoncapi-compat`_).
It's out of scope for CPython’s C API, and this PEP.

.. _pythoncapi-compat: https://github.com/python/pythoncapi-compat

To sketch how such a mechanism could work:

The main issue that prevents compatibility with Python 3.14 is that with
opaque ``PyObject`` and ``PyModuleDef``, it is not feasible to initialize
an extension module.
The solution, :pep:`793`, is only being added in Python 3.15.

It is possible to work around this using the fact that the 3.14 ABIs (both
free-threading and GIL-enabled) are “frozen”, so it is possible for an
extension to query the running interpreter, and for 3.14, use
a ``struct`` definition corresponding to the detected build's ``PyModuleDef``.


Naming this ``abi4``
--------------------

Instead of ``abi3t``, we could “bump the version” and use ``abi4`` instead.
The difference is largely cosmetic.

However, one thing this PEP does not propose is changing the *filename*
tag: extensions will be named with the extensions like ``.abi3.so``.
Changing this while keeping compatibility with GIL-enabled builds would be
an unnecessary technical change.

Using ``abi3.abi4`` in wheel tags but only ``.abi3`` in filenames would
look more inconsistent than ``abi3.abi3t`` and ``.abi3``.

If we added an ``abi4`` tag, the ``Py_LIMITED_API`` value would either need to:

* change to start with ``4`` to match ``abi4``, but no longer correspond
  to ``PY_VERSION_HEX`` (making it harder to generate and check), or
* not change, making it inconsistent with ``abi4``.

Adding ``abi3t`` is a smaller change than adding ``abi4``, making it work
better as a transitional state before larger changes like :pep:`809`'s
``abi2026``.


Reusing ``Py_GIL_DISABLED`` to enable the new ABI
-------------------------------------------------

It would be possible to select ``abi3t`` (rather than ``abi3``) when the
``Py_GIL_DISABLED`` macro is defined together with ``Py_LIMITED_API``.

This would require annoying fiddling with buil flags, and make it
especially cumbersome to target *both* ``abi3`` and ``abi3t`` at the same time.


Making the new version of ``abi3`` compatible with free-threading
-----------------------------------------------------------------

It would be possible to make ``PyObject`` opaque in Limited API 3.15,
rather than add a new stable ABI.
This would make all extensions built for the Stable ABI 3.15 and above
compatible with both free-threading and GIL-enabled Python.

In the `PEP discussion <https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-803-stable-abi-for-free-threaded-builds/103628/56>`__,
the ability to build for the GIL-only Stable ABI with no source changes
was deemed to be worth an extra configuration macro (``Py_TARGET_ABI3T``).
