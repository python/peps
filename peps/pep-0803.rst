PEP: 803
Title: Stable ABI for Free-Threaded Builds
Author: Petr Viktorin <encukou@gmail.com>
Discussions-To: https://discuss.python.org/t/103628
Status: Draft
Type: Standards Track
Requires: 703, 793, 697
Created: 19-Aug-2025
Python-Version: 3.15
Post-History: `08-Sep-2025 <https://discuss.python.org/t/103628>`__


Abstract
========

Version 3.15 of the Stable ABI will be compatible with both free-threaded and
GIL-enabled builds.
To allow this, the :c:type:`PyObject` internal structure and related APIs
will be removed from version 3.15 of the Limited API, requiring migration to
new API for common tasks like defining modules and most classes.

Binary distributions (wheels) built with Limited API version 3.15 and above
should use the ABI tag ``abi3.abi3t``.


Terminology
===========

This PEP uses “GIL-enabled build” as an antonym to “free-threaded build”,
that is, an interpreter or extension built without ``Py_GIL_DISABLED``.


Motivation
==========

The Stable ABI is currently not available for free-threaded builds.
Extensions will fail to build when :c:macro:`Py_LIMITED_API` is defined,
and extensions built for GIL-enabled builds of CPython will fail to load
(or crash) on free-threaded builds.

In its `acceptance post <https://discuss.python.org/t/84319/123>`__
for :pep:`779`, the Steering Council stated that it “expects that Stable ABI
for free-threading should be prepared and defined for Python 3.15”.

This PEP proposes the Stable ABI for free-threading.


Background
----------

Python's Stable ABI, as defined in :pep:`384` and :pep:`652`, provides a way to
compile extension modules that can be loaded on multiple minor versions of the
CPython interpreter.
Several projects use this to limit the number of
:ref:`wheels <packaging:binary-distribution-format>` (binary artefacts)
that need to be built and distributed for each release, and/or to make it
easier to test with pre-release versions of Python.

With free-threading builds (:pep:`703`) being on track to eventually become
the default (:pep:`779`), we need a way to make the Stable ABI available
to those builds.

To build against the Stable ABI, the extension must use a *Limited API*,
that is, only a subset of the functions, structures, etc. that CPython
exposes.
Both the Limited API and the Stable ABI are versioned, and building against
Stable ABI 3.X requires using only Limited API 3.X, and yields an extension
that is ABI-compatible with CPython 3.X and *any* later version
(though bugs in CPython sometimes cause incompatibilities in practice).

The Limited API is not “stable”: newer versions may remove API that
were a part of older versions.
This PEP proposes the most significant such removal to date.


Rationale
=========

The design in this PEP makes several assumptions:

One ABI
   A single compiled extension module should support both
   free-threaded and GIL-enabled builds.

No backwards compatibility now
   The new limited API will not support CPython 3.14 and below.
   Projects that need this support can build separate extensions specifically
   for the 3.14 free-threaded interpreter, and for older stable ABI versions.

   However, we won't block the possibility of extending compatibility to
   CPython 3.14 and below.
   See a :ref:`rejected idea <pep803-no-shim>` for how this could work.

API changes are OK
   The new Limited API may require extension authors to make significant
   changes to their code.
   Projects that cannot do this (yet) can continue using Limited API 3.14,
   which will yield extensions compatible with GIL-enabled builds only.

No extra configuration
   We do not introduce new “knobs” that influence what API is available
   and what the ABI is compatible with.


Specification
=============


Opaque PyObject
---------------

Version 3.15 of the Limited API will:

- make the following structures *opaque* (or in C terminology, *incomplete
  types*):

  - :c:type:`PyObject`
  - :c:type:`PyVarObject`
  - :c:type:`!PyModuleDef_Base`
  - :c:type:`PyModuleDef`

- no longer include the following macros:

  - :c:macro:`PyObject_HEAD`
  - :c:macro:`!_PyObject_EXTRA_INIT`
  - :c:macro:`PyObject_HEAD_INIT`
  - :c:macro:`PyObject_VAR_HEAD`
  - :c:func:`Py_SET_TYPE`

- export the following as functions in the ABI, rather than macros:

  - :c:func:`Py_SIZE`
  - :c:func:`Py_SET_SIZE`


Implications
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Making the ``PyObject``, ``PyVarObject`` and ``PyModuleDef`` structures
opaque means:

- Their fields may not be directly accessed.

  For example, instead of ``o->ob_type``, extensions must use
  ``Py_TYPE(o)``.
  This usage has been the preferred practice for some time.

- Their size and alignment will not be available.
  Expressions such as ``sizeof(PyObject)`` will no longer work.

- They cannot be embedded in other structures.
  This mainly affects instance structs of extension-defined types,
  which will need to be defined using API added in :pep:`697` -- that is,
  using a ``struct`` *without* ``PyObject`` (or other base class struct) at
  the beginning, with :c:func:`PyObject_GetTypeData` calls needed to access
  the memory.

- Variables of these types cannot be created.
  This mainly affects static ``PyModuleDef`` variables needed to define
  extension modules.
  Extensions will need to switch to API added in :pep:`793`.

The following functions will become unusable in practice (in the new Limited
API), since an extension cannot create valid, statically allocated, input
for them. To ease the transition for extension developers,
they will not yet be removed from the Limited API:

- :c:func:`PyModuleDef_Init`
- :c:func:`PyModule_Create`, :c:func:`PyModule_Create2`
- :c:func:`PyModule_FromDefAndSpec`, :c:func:`PyModule_FromDefAndSpec2`


New Export Hook (PEP 793)
-------------------------

Implementation of this PEP requires :pep:`793` (``PyModExport``):
A new entry  point for C extension modules), which was accepted for Python
3.15.

Since existing ways of defining modules use API that this PEP removes
(namely, :c:type:`PyModuleDef`), extensions will need to migrate to PEP 793's
new “export hook” when switching to Limited API 3.15.


Runtime ABI checks
------------------

Users -- or rather the tools they use for building and installing extensions --
will continue to be responsible for not putting incompatible extensions on
Python's import paths.
This decision makes sense since tools typically have much richer metadata than
what CPython can check.
Typically, build tools and installers use `PyPA packaging metadata`_ and
`platform compatibility tags`_ to communicate compatibility details, but other
models are possible.

.. _PyPA packaging metadata: https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/core-metadata/
.. _platform compatibility tags: https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/platform-compatibility-tags/

However, CPython will add a line of defense against outdated or misconfigured
tools, or human mistakes, in the form of a new *module slot* containing
basic ABI information.
This information will be checked when a module is loaded, and incompatible
extensions will be rejected.
The specifics are left to the C API working group
(see `issue 72 <https://github.com/capi-workgroup/decisions/issues/72>`__).

This slot will become *mandatory* with the new export hook added in
:pep:`793`.
(That PEP currently says “there are no required slots”; it will be updated.)


Check for older ``abi3``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Additionally, in free-threaded builds, :c:func:`PyModuleDef_Init` will detect
extensions using the pre-free-threading Stable ABI, emit an informative
message when one is loaded, *and* raise an exception.
(Implementation note: A message will be printed before raising the exception,
because extensions that attempt to handle an exception using incompatible ABI
will likely crash and lose the exception's message.)

This check for older ``abi3`` relies on internal bit patterns and may be
removed in future CPython versions, if the internal object layout needs
to change.


The ``abi3t`` wheel tag
-----------------------

Wheels that use a stable ABI compatible with free-threading CPython builds
should use a new `ABI tag`_: ``abi3t``.
The name is chosen to reflect the fact that this ABI is similar to ``abi3``,
with limitations necessary to support free-threading (which uses the letter
``t`` in existing, version-specific ABI tags like ``cp314t``).

.. _ABI tag: https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/platform-compatibility-tags/#abi-tag

Package installers should treat this tag as completely separate from ``abi3``.
They should allow ``abi3t``-tagged wheels for free-threaded builds wherever
they currently allow ``abi3``-tagged ones for (orherwise equal) non-free-threaded
builds.

Build tools should generate ``abi3.abi3t`` instead of ``abi3`` when the Python
tag is ``cp315`` and above (or equivalently: when setting ``Py_LIMITED_API``
to ``3.15`` (``0x030f0000``) or above).
``abi3.abi3t`` is a `compressed tag set`_ that signals compatibility with both
``abi3`` and ``abi3t``.

.. _compressed tag set: https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/platform-compatibility-tags/#compressed-tag-sets

.. note::

   The version of the Stable ABI is indicated by the `Python wheel tag`_; this
   PEP does not change that.
   For example, a wheel tagged ``cp315-abi3.abi3t`` will be compatible with
   3.15, 3.16, and later versions;
   ``cp317-abi3.abi3t`` will be compatible with 3.17+.

.. _Python wheel tag: https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/platform-compatibility-tags/#python-tag

The ``abi3t`` tag can be used in extensions compatible with earlier versions of
free-threaded Python.
For example, an extension compatible with GIL-enabled *and* free-threaded
builds of *3.14*, 3.15, and higher versions would be tagged
``cpy314-abi3.abi3t``.
This PEP does not propose an official way to build such extensions, but since
a mechanism for that can be added later (see
:ref:`a Rejected idea <pep803-no-shim>`), installers should be ready to accept
the tag.


New API
-------

Implementing this PEP will make it possible to build extensions that
can be successfully loaded on free-threaded Python, but not necessarily ones
that are thread-safe without a GIL.

Limited API to allow thread-safety without a GIL -- presumably ``PyMutex``, ``PyCriticalSection``, and
similar -- will be added via the C API working group, or in a follow-up PEP.


Backwards and Forwards Compatibility
====================================

Limited API 3.15 will not be backwards-compatible with older CPython releases,
due to the need to use new ``PyModExport`` API added in :pep:`793`.

Extension authors who cannot switch may continue to use Limited API 3.14
and below.
For compatibility with free-threaded builds, they can compile using
version-specific ABI -- for example, compile on CPython 3.15 without defining
``Py_LIMITED_API``.

Limited API 3.15 will be forward-compatible with future versions of CPython 3.x.
Older versions of the Limited API (that is, 3.14 and below) will continue
to be forward-compatible with GIL-enabled builds of CPython 3.x, starting with
the version that introduced the given Limited API.

Security Implications
=====================

None known.


How to Teach This
=================

A porting guide will need to explain how to move to APIs added in
:pep:`697` (Limited C API for Extending Opaque Types)
and :pep:`793` (``PyModExport``).


Reference Implementation
========================

This PEP combines several pieces, implemented individually:

- Opaque ``PyObject`` is available in CPython main branch after defining the
  ``_Py_OPAQUE_PYOBJECT`` macro.
  Implemented in GitHub pull request `python/cpython#136505
  <https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/136505>`__.
- For ``PyModExport``, see :pep:`793` and
  `GitHub issue #140550 <https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/140550>`_.
- A version-checking slot was implemented in GitHub pull request
  `python/cpython#137212 <https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/137212>`__.
- A check for older ``abi3`` was implemented in GitHub pull request
  `python/cpython#137957 <https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/137957>`__.
- For wheel tags, there is no implementation yet.
- A porting guide is not yet written.


Rejected Ideas
==============


Add an alternative stable ABI for free-threading
------------------------------------------------

It would be possible to:

- Add a new stable ABI (“``abi3t``”) specifically for free-threading,
  which would be incompatible with the existing ``abi3``.
  Extensions would need no code changes to target ``abi3t`` and builds would be
  compatible with free-threaded CPython (3.14 and above).
- Define an additional macro (“``Py_OPAQUE_PYOBJECT``”), which would make
  ``PyObject`` opaque as in this PEP. Extensions would need code changes as in
  this PEP, and as in this PEP, compiled extensions (“``abi3.abi3t``”) would
  be compatible with all builds of CPython 3.15+.

This scheme was rejected as too complex.
It would also make the free-threading memory layout of ``PyObject`` part
of the stable ABI, preventing future adjustments.


.. _pep803-no-shim:

Shims for compatibility with CPython 3.14
-----------------------------------------

It’s possible to build a ``cp314-abi3.abi3t`` extension – one compatible
with 3.14 (both free-threaded build and default).
There are several challenges around this:

* making it convenient and safe for general extensions
* testing it (as CPython’s test suite doesn’t involve other CPython versions
  than the one being tested)

So, providing a mechanism to build such extensions is best suited to an
external project (for example, one like `pythoncapi-compat`_).
It's out of scope for CPython’s C API, and this PEP.

.. _pythoncapi-compat: https://github.com/python/pythoncapi-compat

To sketch how such a mechanism could work:

The main issue that prevents compatibility with Python 3.14 is that with
opaque ``PyObject`` and ``PyModuleDef``, it is not feasible to initialize
an extension module.
The solution, :pep:`793`, is only being added in Python 3.15.

It is possible to work around this using the fact that the 3.14 ABIs (both
free-threading and GIL-enabled) are “frozen”, so it is possible for an
extension to query the running interpreter, and for 3.14, use
a ``struct`` definition corresponding to the detected build's ``PyModuleDef``.


.. _pep803-no-avoid-abi3t:

Using the Python version wheel tag to determine compatibility
-------------------------------------------------------------

A previous version of this PEP avoided adding a new wheel tag (``abi3t``),
and specified that wheels tagged ``abi3`` would be compatible with
free-threading if the *Python tag* is ``cp315`` or higher.

Such a scheme would work for this PEP, but it cannot express that an extension
is compatible with both GIL-enabled and free-threaded builds
of CPython 3.14 or lower.
Adding a new explicit tag means that *if* we allow building such wheels in the
future, packaging tools should not need additional changes to support them.
They would be tagged ``cp314-abi3.abi3t``.


Adding an ``abi4`` wheel tag
----------------------------

Instead of ``abi3t``, we could “bump the version” and use ``abi4`` instead
as the wheel ABI tag.
In the wheel tag, the difference is largely cosmetic.

However, one thing this PEP does not propose is changing the *filename*
tag: extensions will be named with the extensions like ``.abi3.so``.
Changing this while keeping compatibility with GIL-enabled builds would be
an unnecessary technical change.

Using ``abi3.abi4`` in wheel tags but only ``.abi3`` in filenames would
look more inconsistent than ``abi3.abi3t`` and ``.abi3``.

If we add ``abi4`` tag, the ``Py_LIMITED_API`` value would either need to:

* change to start with ``4`` to match ``abi4``, but no longer correspond
  to ``PY_VERSION_HEX`` (making it harder to generate and check), or
* not change, making it inconsistent with ``abi4``.

Adding ``abi3t`` is a smaller change than adding ``abi4``, making it work
better as a transitional state before larger changes like :pep:`809`'s
``abi2026``.
