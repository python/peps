Abstract
========

Wheels currently do not handle symlinks well, copying content instead of making symlinks when
installed. To properly handle distributing libraries in wheels, we propose a new ``LINKS``
metadata file to handle symlinks in a platform portable manner. This specification requires
a new wheel major version, discussed in :pep:`777`.

Motivation
==========

Today, symlinks in wheels get created as copies of files, as `the zipfile module
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html>`_ in CPython `does not support handling symlinks
in-place <https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/82102>`_ for security reasons.

This `presents problems to projects that would like to ship large compiled libraries
<https://pypackaging-native.github.io/other_issues/#lack-of-support-for-symlinks-in-wheels>`_ in
wheels, as they must choose to either greatly increase the install size of the project on disk,
or omit the symlink and potentially break some downstream use cases.

To ship a library that can properly be loaded for runtime use or build time linking on Unix, a
library should follow conventions of Unix loader and linker search. The two main file names for
the loader to use is the "soname" and the "real name". The "soname" is a file like
``libfoo.so.3`` where ``3`` is a number that is incremented when the interface of the library
changes. The "real name" is a file named like ``libfoo.so.3.1.4``, where the extra version
information lets the loader find a specific version of a library. Finally, when compiling code to
link against a library, the linker searches for a "linker name", named like ``libfoo.so``. A more
detailed description is described in `this Linux documentation on shared libraries
<https://tldp.org/HOWTO/Program-Library-HOWTO/shared-libraries.html>`_. To fully support all
runtime and build time use cases, a project requires shipping all 3 files. Normally, this is
handled on Unix by using symlinks, so that the library is not duplicated on disk 3 times.

Returning to Python packaging, there are many popular projects which ship binary libraries, such as
``numpy``, ``scipy``, and ``pyarrow``. Other site-packages ``dlopen`` libraries in other wheels, such as
``pytorch`` and ``jax``. These projects currently rely on a single library in the wheel, but
this can cause the linker to find the wrong library if there are system libraries that have a
"real name" library version available.

There is also the potential benefit that symlinks in wheels would allow for simpler editable
installs by simply placing a symlink in the user's ``site-packages`` directory, but this PEP
leaves that as an open question to be explored in a future PEP.

Rationale
=========

To support the 3 main namings of a library used in loading and library linking on Unix, we
propose adding support for symlinks in Python wheels. To allow for tracking symlinks made, and to
potentially support other platforms that may not support Unix symlinks directly, we propose the
use of a new wheel metadata file ``LINKS``, which will exist in the ``.dist-info`` directory alongside
``METADATA``, ``RECORD``, and other metadata files.

Using a ``LINKS`` file will allow for more cross-platform uses of symlink-like usage. On Windows,
symlinks require either `a group policy allowing the user to make symlinks
<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-10/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/create-symbolic-links>`_
(e.g. by enabling `Dev Mode
<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/get-started/enable-your-device-for-development>`_)
or Administrative permissions. This means that it may be the case that symlinks are unsupported on
some user systems. By using a ``LINKS`` file, installers will be able to potentially use other
methods of handlings symlinks, such as junctions on Windows, where otherwise the installer would
have to fail.

This PEP also describes checks that installers must make when installing an updated wheel. These
checks exist to handle security risks from allowing wheels to install symlinks. For more
information on why these checks are important, see `Security Implications`_.

Specification
=============

Wheel Major Version Bump
------------------------

This PEP requires a wheel major version bump, so the ``Wheel-Version`` for wheels generated with
``LINKS`` **MUST** be at least version ``2.0``, so that older installers do not silently fail to
install symlinks and break user environments. For more see :pep:`777`.

New ``LINKS`` Metadata File
---------------------------

To enable cross-platform symlinks, this PEP introduces a new wheel metadata file, ``LINKS``. An
example of a ``LINKS`` file is below::

    my_package/libfoo.so.3.1.4,my_package/libfoo.so.3
    my_package/libfoo.so.3,my_package/libfoo.so

The format of ``LINKS``, as can seen above, is ``source_path,target_path`` where ``source_path``
is a path relative to the root of any namespace or package root in the wheel. ``target_path`` is a
*non-dangling* path (i.e. a path that exists on the filesystem after the wheel's contents are
extracted) in a package or namespace of any package in the wheel. This means that if a wheel
contains multiple packages, all paths in packages in the wheel are acceptable.

Installer Behavior Specification
--------------------------------

Installers **MUST** resolve the paths of any link contained in the ``LINKS`` file *before*
deciding if any ``source_path`` or ``target_path`` are valid. Installers **MUST** verify that
``source_path`` and ``target_path`` are located inside any namespace or package coming from the
wheel.  Installers **MUST** reject cyclic symlinks in wheels. Installers **MAY** error if a long
chain of symlinks (symlinks pointing to symlinks many times repeated) exceeds a limit set by the
installer.

Installers **MUST** follow the following steps when handling a wheel with symlinks:

1. Check for the existance of a ``LINKS`` file in the ``.dist-info``. If it does not exist,
   no further steps are required.
2. Extract all files in the wheel packages and data directory as in wheel 1.x.
3. Verify that for each ``source_path`` and ``target_path`` pairs, the ``target_path`` exists in
   one of the package namespaces just extracted.
4. Next, check that the installer can make some kind of link for each pair in the site directory.
   If the installer cannot make a link for the file/folder ``target_path`` for the current
   platform, an error **MUST** be raised. An example of a failure mode would be a UNIX symlink to
   a file target, where the installer is running on Windows and the installer cannot make
   symlinks but can make junctions. In this case the installer **MUST** error because it cannot
   handle the link.
5. Finally, the installer **MUST** add a platform-relevant link between ``source_path`` and
   ``target_path``.

Installers **MUST NOT** by default copy files instead of generating a symlink when handling
symlinks. Installers **MAY** have such behavior available under an alternate configuration or
command line flag.

Build Backend Specification
---------------------------

When creating a wheel, build backends **MUST** treat symlinks in the same way as its target when
deciding whether to include the symlink in a wheel. Build backends **MUST** verify that there are
no dangling symlinks in the ``LINKS`` file. Build backends **SHOULD** recognize platform-relevant
symlinks that would be included in builds. On Unix this is typically symlinks, on Windows this
includes symlinks and junctions.

Backwards Compatibility
=======================

Introducing symlinks would require an increment to the wheel format major version. This would mean
new wheels that use the new wheel format would raise an error on older installer tools, per the
`wheel specification
<https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/binary-distribution-format/#file-contents>`_.

Please see :pep:`777` on "Wheel 2.0".

Security Implications
=====================

Symlinks can be quite dangerous if not handled carefully. A simple example would be if a user were
to run ``sudo pip install malicious``, and there were no protections, then the malicious package
could overwrite ``/etc/shadow`` and replace the password hash on the system, allowing malicious
logins.

This PEP lists several requirements on checks to run by installers on symlinks in wheels to ensure
attacks like the one described above cannot happen. This means it is **critical** that installers
carefully implement these security safeguards and prevent malicious use on package installation.

In particular, the following checks **MUST** be made by installers:

1. That the symlinks do not point outside of any packages or namespaces coming from the wheel
2. That the symlinks are not dangling (the target exists at install time)
3. That the symlinks are not cyclical, stopping after a certain depth of checking to avoid denial
   of service requests

Do not follow symlinks on removal.

How to Teach This
=================

End users should, once the changes have propagated through the ecosystem, transparently experience
the benefits of symlinks in wheels. It is important for installers to give clear error messages if
symlinks are unsupported on the platform, and explain why installation has failed.

For people building libraries, documentation on ``packaging.python.org`` should describe the use
cases and caveats (especially platform suppport) of symlinks in wheels. Otherwise it should be
handled transparently by build backends in the same way any normal file would be handled.

Reference Implementation
========================

TODO

Rejected Ideas
==============

Just Use Unix Symlinks Everywhere
---------------------------------

This PEP wants to allow for ``LINKS`` to be used for a potential future :pep:`660` editable
installation. This future PEP should support Windows, so it may need to use junctions.

Don't Use Junctions in ``LINKS``
--------------------------------

Junctions are a limited way to support symlinks between folders on Windows. They do not support
files. This PEP allows for junctions as users may wish to only link folders to a different
location, and future :pep:`660` implementations may need to rely on this feature.

Put symlinks in the ``RECORD`` Metadata File
--------------------------------------------

While this could be done, it would clutter the ``RECORD`` file. Furthermore the most
straightforward implementation would place the target at the end of the record. This would
make it harder to scan across the line and visually see what symlinks exist in the wheel.

Library Maintainers Should Use Python to Locate Libraries
---------------------------------------------------------

Using Python to locate libraries would be much easier. However, some libraries like ``libtorch``
are used by extension modules and themselves require loading dependencies. Some compiled libraries
cannot use Python to find their loader dependencies.

Include Support for Hardlinks
-----------------------------

This PEP does not specify any behavior around hardlinks. This is intentional. This is left as an
extension to a future PEP.

Open Issues
===========

PEP 660 and Deferring Editable Installation Support
------------------------------------------------------

This PEP leaves the specification and implementation of a :pep:`660` editable installation
mechanism as unresolved for a later PEP, should we specify that here?

Security
--------

This PEP needs to be reviewed to make sure it would not allow for new security vulnerabilities.
Are there other restrictions we should place on the source or target of symlinks to protect users?

Allow inter-package symlinks
----------------------------

This could be useful for projects that want to shard dependencies such as large libraries between
wheels but make them available in the main parent wheel.

The Format of ``LINKS``
-----------------------

Currently the format is derived from ``RECORD``, but perhaps a better format exists.
