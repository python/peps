Introduction
============

The Python Standard Library contributes significantly to Python's
success.  The language comes with "batteries included", so it is easy
for people to become productive with just the standard library alone.
It is therefore important that the usefulness of the standard library
be maintained.

Due to the visibility and importance of the standard library, it must
be maintained thoughtfully. As such, any code within it must be
maintained by Python's development team which leads to a perpetual
cost to each addition made. There is also added cognitive load for
users in familiarizing themselves with what is in the standard
library to be considered.

New functionality is commonly added to the library in the form of new
modules. This PEP will describe the procedure for the *addition* of
new modules.  :pep:`4` deals with procedures for deprecation of modules;
the *removal* of old and unused modules from the standard library.


Acceptance Procedure
====================

For top-level modules/packages, a PEP is required. The procedure for
writing a PEP is covered in :pep:`1`.

For submodules of a preexisting package in the standard library,
additions are at the discretion of the general Python development team
and its members.

General guidance on what modules typically are accepted into the
standard library, the overall process, etc. are covered in the
`developer's guide <https://devguide.python.org/stdlibchanges/>`_.


Maintenance Procedure
=====================

Anything accepted into the standard library is expected to be
primarily maintained there, within Python's development infrastructure.
While some members of the development team may choose to maintain a
backport of a module outside of the standard library, it is up to them
to keep their external code in sync as appropriate.
