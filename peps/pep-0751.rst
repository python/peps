Abstract
========

This PEP proposes a new file format for specifying dependencies
to enable reproducible installation in a Python environment. The format is
designed to be human-readable and machine-generated. Installers consuming the
file should be able to calculate what to install without the need for dependency
resolution at install-time.


==========
Motivation
==========

Currently, no standard exists to create an immutable record, such as a lock
file, which specifies what direct and indirect dependencies should be installed
into a virtual environment.

Considering there are at least five well-known solutions to this problem in the
community (PDM_, ``pip freeze``, pip-tools_, Poetry_, and uv_), there seems to
be an appetite for lock files in general.

Those tools also vary in what locking scenarios they support. For instance,
``pip freeze`` and pip-tools only generate lock files for the current
environment while PDM, Poetry, and uv can/try to lock for multiple environments
at once. There's also concerns around the lack of secure defaults in the face of
supply chain attacks (e.g. including hashes for files).

The lack of a standard also has some drawbacks. For instance, any tooling that
wants to work with lock files must choose which format to support, potentially
leaving users unsupported (e.g. Dependabot_ only supporting select tools,
same for cloud providers who can do dependency installations on your behalf,
etc.). It also impacts portability between tools, which causes vendor lock-in.
By not having compatibility and interoperability it fractures tooling around
lock files where both users and tools have to choose what lock file format to
use upfront and making it costly to use/switch to other formats (e.g. tooling
around auditing a lock file). Rallying around a single format removes this
cost/barrier.

The closest the community has to a standard are pip's `requirements files`_
which all the aforementioned tools either use directly as their file format or
export to (i.e. ``requirements.txt``). Unfortunately, the format is not a
standard but is supported by convention. It's also designed very much for pip's
needs, limiting its flexibility and ease of use (e.g. it's a bespoke file
format). Lastly, it is not secure by default (e.g. file hash support is
entirely an opt-in feature, you have to tell pip to not look for other
dependencies outside of what's in the requirements file, etc.).

.. note::

   Much of the motivation from :pep:`665` also applies to this PEP.


=========
Rationale
=========

The file format proposed by this PEP is designed to be human-readable. This is
so that the contents of the file can be audited by a human to make sure no
undesired dependencies end up being included in the lock file.

The file format is also designed to not require a resolver at install time. This
greatly simplifies reasoning about what would be installed when consuming a lock
file. It should also lead to faster installs which are much more frequent than
creating a lock file.

The data in the file should be consumable by tools not written in Python. This
allows for e.g. cloud hosting providers to write their own tool to perform
installations in their preferred programming language.

The file format should promote good security defaults. As the format is not
meant to be human-writable, this means having tools provide security-related
details is reasonable and not a costly burden.

The contents of a lock file should be able to replace the vast majority of uses
of `requirements files`_ when used as a lock file (e.g. what
pip-tools_ and ``pip freeze`` emit). This means the file format specified by
this PEP can, at minimum, act as an export target for tools which have their own
internal lock file format.


=============
Specification
=============

---------
File Name
---------

A lock file MUST be named :file:`pylock.toml` or match the regular expression
``r"^pylock\.([^.]+)\.toml$"`` if a name for the lock file is desired or if multiple
lock files exist. The use of the ``.toml`` file extension is to make syntax
highlighting in editors easier and to reinforce the fact that the file format is
meant to be human-readable. The prefix and suffix of a named file MUST be
lowercase when possible, for easy detection and removal,
e.g.:

.. code-block:: Python

  if len(filename) > 11 and filename.startswith("pylock.") and filename.endswith(".toml"):
      name = filename.removeprefix("pylock.").removesuffix(".toml")

The expectation is that services that install lock files automatically will
search for a lock file with the service's name, then fallback to the generic
``pylock.toml`` (e.g. a cloud host service named Spam would first look for
``pylock.spam.toml`` to install, and if that file didn't exist then install from
``pylock.toml``).

The lock file(s) SHOULD be located in the directory as appropriate for the scope
of the lock file. Locking against a single ``pyproject.toml``, for instance,
would place the ``pylock.toml`` in the same directory. If the lock file covered
multiple projects in a monorepo, then the expectation is the ``pylock.toml``
file would be in the directory that held all the projects being locked.


-----------
File Format
-----------

The format of the file is TOML_.

Tools SHOULD write their lock files in a consistent way to minimize noise in
diff output. Keys in tables -- including the top-level table -- SHOULD be
recorded in a consistent order (if inspiration is desired, this PEP has tried to
write down keys in a logical order). As well, tools SHOULD sort arrays in
consistent order. Usage of inline tables SHOULD also be kept consistent.


``lock-version``
================

- **Type**: string; value of ``"1.0"``
- **Required?**: yes
- **Inspiration**: :ref:`packaging:core-metadata-metadata-version`
- Record the file format version that the file adheres to.
- This PEP specifies the initial version -- and only valid value until future
  updates to the standard change it -- as ``"1.0"``.
- If a tool supports the major version but not the minor version, a tool
  SHOULD warn when an unknown key is seen.
- If an tool doesn't support a major version, it MUST raise an error.


``environments``
================

- **Type**: Array of strings
- **Required?**: no
- **Inspiration**: uv_
- A list of :ref:`packaging:dependency-specifiers-environment-markers` for
  which the lock file is considered compatible with.
- Tools SHOULD write exclusive/non-overlapping environment markers to ease in
  understanding.


``requires-python``
===================

- **Type**: string
- **Required?**: no
- **Inspiration**: PDM_, Poetry_, uv_
- Specifies the :ref:`packaging:core-metadata-requires-python` for the minimum
  Python version compatible for any environment supported by the lock file
  (i.e. the minimum viable Python version for the lock file).


``created-by``
==============

- **Type**: string
- **Required?**: yes
- **Inspiration**: Tools with their name in their lock file name
- Records the name of the tool used to create the lock file.
- Tools MAY use the ``[tool]`` table to record enough details that it can be
  inferred what inputs were used to create the lock file.
- Tools SHOULD record the normalized name of the tool if it is available as a
  Python package to facilitate finding the tool.


``[[packages]]``
================

- **Type**: array of tables
- **Required?**: yes
- **Inspiration**: PDM_, Poetry_, uv_
- An array containing all packages that *may* be installed.
- Packages MAY be listed multiple times with varying data, but all packages to
  be installed MUST narrow down to a single entry at install time.


.. Identification

``packages.name``
-----------------

- **Type**: string
- **Required?**: yes
- **Inspiration**: :ref:`packaging:core-metadata-name`
- The name of the package :ref:`normalized <packaging:name-normalization>`.


``packages.version``
--------------------

- **Type**: string
- **Required?**: no
- **Inspiration**: :ref:`packaging:core-metadata-version`
- The version of the package.
- The version SHOULD be specified when the version is known to be stable
  (i.e. when an :ref:`sdist <packaging:source-distribution-format>` or
  :ref:`wheels <packaging:binary-distribution-format>` are specified).
- The version MUST NOT be included when it cannot be guaranteed to be consistent
  with the code used (i.e. when a
  :ref:`source tree <packaging:source-distribution-format-source-tree>` is
  used).


.. Requirements

``packages.marker``
-------------------

- **Type**: string
- **Required?**: no
- **Inspiration**: PDM_
- The
  :ref:`environment marker <packaging:dependency-specifiers-environment-markers>`
  which specify when the package should be installed.


``packages.requires-python``
----------------------------

- **Type**: string
- **Required?**: no
- **Inspiration**: :ref:`packaging:core-metadata-requires-python`
- Holds the :ref:`packaging:version-specifiers` for Python version compatibility
  for the package.


``[[packages.dependencies]]``
-----------------------------

- **Type**: array of tables
- **Required?**: no
- **Inspiration**: PDM_, Poetry_, uv_
- Records the other entries in ``[[packages]]`` which are direct dependencies of
  this package.
- Each entry is a table which contains the minimum information required to tell
  which other package entry it corresponds to where doing a key-by-key
  comparison would find the appropriate package with no ambiguity (e.g. if there
  are two entries for the ``spam`` package, then you can include the version
  number like ``{name = "spam", version = "1.0.0"}``, or by source like
  ``{name = "spam", vcs = { url = "..."}``).
- Tools MUST NOT use this information when doing installation; it is purely
  informational for auditing purposes.


.. Installation

``packages.direct``
-------------------

- **Type**: boolean
- **Required?**: no; defaults to ``false``
- **Inspiration**: :ref:`packaging:direct-url`

  :ref:`source tree <packaging:source-distribution-format-source-tree>` it
  contains.

------------
Installation
------------

The following outlines the steps to be taken to install from a lock file
(while the requirements are prescriptive, the general steps and order are
a suggestion):

#. Check if the metadata version specified by ``lock-version`` is supported;
   an error or warning MUST be raised as appropriate.
#. If ``requires-python`` is specified, check that the environment being
   installed for meets the requirement; an error MUST be raised if it is not
   met.
#. If ``environments`` is specified, check that at least one of the environment
   marker expressions is satisfied; an error MUST be raised if no expression is
   satisfied.
#. For each package listed in ``[[packages]]``:

   #. If ``marker`` is specified, check if it is satisfied; if it isn't,
      skip to the next package.
   #. If ``requires-python`` is specified, check if it is satisfied; an error
      MUST be raised if it isn't.
   #. Check that no other instance of the package has been slated to be
      installed; an error about the ambiguity MUST be raised otherwise.
   #. Check that the source of the package is specified appropriately (i.e.
      there are not conflicting sources in the package entry);
      an error MUST be raised if any issues are found.
   #. Add the package to the set of packages to install.

#. For each package to be installed:

   - If ``vcs`` is set:

     #. Clone the repository to the commit ID specified in ``commit-id``.
     #. Build the package, respecting ``subdirectory``.
     #. Install.

   - Else if ``directory`` is set:

     #. Build the package, respecting ``subdirectory``.
     #. Install.

   - Else if ``archive`` is set:

     #. Get the file.
     #. Validate the file size and hash.
     #. Build the package, respecting ``subdirectory``.
     #. Install.

   - Else if there are entries for ``wheels``:

     #. Look for the appropriate wheel file based on ``name``; if one is not
        found then move on to ``sdist`` or an error MUST be raised about a
        lack of source for the project.
     #. Get the file:

        - If ``path`` is set, use it.
        - If ``url`` is set, try to use it; optionally tools MAY use
          ``packages.index`` or some tool-specific mechanism to download the
          selected wheel file (tools MUST NOT try to change what wheel file to
          download based on what's available; what file to install should be
          determined in an offline fashion for reproducibility).

     #. Validate the file size and hash.
     #. Install.

   - Else if no ``wheel`` file is found or ``sdist`` is solely set:

     #. Get the file.

        - If ``path`` is set, use it.
        - If ``url`` is set, try to use it; tools MAY use
          ``packages.index`` or some tool-specific mechanism to download the
          file.
     #. Validate the file size and hash.
     #. Build the package.
     #. Install.


----------------------------------------------------
Semantic differences with ``requirements.txt`` files
----------------------------------------------------

Ignoring formatting, there are a few differences between lock files as proposed
by this PEP and those that are possible via a `requirements file`_.

Some of the differences are in regards to security. Requiring hashes, recording
file sizes, and where a file was found -- both the index and the location of the
file itself -- help with auditing and validating the files that were locked
against. Compare that with requirements files which can optionally include
hashes, but it is an opt-in feature and can be bypassed. The optional inclusion
of a file's upload time and where the files can be found is also different.

Being explicit about the supported Python versions and environments for the file
overall is also unique to this PEP. This is to alleviate the issue of not
knowing when a requirements file targets a specific platform.

The ``[tool]`` tables don't have a direct correlation in requirements files.
They do support comments, but they are not inherently structured like the
``[tool]`` table is thanks to being in TOML.

While comments in a requirements file could record details that are helpful for
auditing and understanding what the lock file contains, providing the structured
support to record such things makes auditing easier. Recording the required
Python version for a package upfront helps with this as well as erroring out
sooner if an install is going to fail. Recording the wheel file name separate
from the URL or path is also to help make reading the list of wheel files easier
as it encodes information that can be useful when understanding and auditing a
file. Recording the sdist file name is for the same reason.


=======================
Backwards Compatibility
=======================

Because there is no preexisting lock file format, there are no explicit
backwards-compatibility concerns in terms of Python packaging standards.

As for packaging tools themselves, that will be a per-tool decision as to
whether they choose to support this PEP and in what way (i.e. as an export
target or as the primary way they record their lock file).


=====================
Security Implications
=====================

The hope is that by standardizing on a lock file format which starts from a
security-first posture it will help make overall packaging installation safer.
However, this PEP does not solve all potential security concerns.

One potential concern is tampering with a lock file. If a lock file is not kept
in source control and properly audited, a bad actor could change the file in
nefarious ways (e.g., point to a malware version of a package). Tampering could
also occur in transit to e.g. a cloud provider who will perform an installation
on the user's behalf. Both could be mitigated by signing the lock file either
within the file in a ``[tool]`` entry or via a side channel external to the lock
file itself.

This PEP does not do anything to prevent a user from installing incorrect
packages. While including many details to help in auditing a package's inclusion,
there isn't any mechanism to stop e.g. name confusion attacks via
typosquatting. Tools may be able to provide some UX to help with this (e.g. by
providing download counts for a package).


=================
How to Teach This
=================

Users should be informed that when they ask to install some package, the
package may have its own dependencies, those dependencies may have dependencies,
and so on. Without writing down what gets installed as part of installing the
package they requested, things could change from underneath them (e.g. package
versions). Changes to the underlying dependencies can lead to accidental
breakage of their code. Lock files help deal with that by providing a way to
write down what was installed so you can install the exact same thing in the
future.

Having what to install written down also helps in collaborating with others. By
agreeing to a lock file's contents, everyone ends up with the same packages
installed. This helps make sure no one relies on e.g. an API that's only
available in a certain version that not everyone working on the project has
installed.

Lock files also help with security by making sure you always get the same files
installed and not a malicious one that someone may have slipped in. It also
lets one be more deliberate in upgrading their dependencies and thus making sure
the change is on purpose and not one slipped in by a bad actor.


========================
Reference Implementation
========================

A proof-of-concept implementing most of this PEP for various versions
of this PEP can be found at
https://github.com/brettcannon/mousebender/tree/pep . While the various
implementations have not matched the exact format of this PEP, the general
semantic requirements have been implemented before.

Prior to acceptance of this PEP, the PoC will be updated.


==============
Rejected Ideas
==============

--------------------------------------------------------
Recording the dependency graph for installation purposes
--------------------------------------------------------

A previous version of this PEP recorded the dependency graph of packages instead
of a set of packages to install. The idea was that by recording the dependency
graph you not only got more information, but it provided more flexibility by
supporting more features innately (e.g. platform-specific dependencies without
explicitly propagating markers).

In the end, though, it was deemed to add complexity that wasn't worth the cost
(e.g. it impacted the ease of auditing for details which were not necessary
for this PEP to reach its goals).


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Specifying a new core metadata version that requires consistent metadata across files
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At one point, to handle the issue of metadata varying between files and thus
require examining every released file for a package and version for accurate
locking results, the idea was floated to introduce a new core metadata version
which would require all metadata for all wheel files be the same for a single
version of a package. Ultimately, though, it was deemed unnecessary as this PEP
will put pressure on people to make files consistent for performance reasons or
to make indexes provide all the metadata separate from the wheel files
themselves. As well, there's no easy enforcement mechanism, and so community
expectation would work as well as a new metadata version.


-------------------------------------------
Have the installer do dependency resolution
-------------------------------------------

In order to support a format more akin to how Poetry worked when this PEP was
drafted, it was suggested that lockers effectively record the packages and their
versions which may be necessary to make an install work in any possible
scenario, and then the installer resolves what to install. But that complicates
auditing a lock file by requiring much more mental effort to know what packages
may be installed in any given scenario. Also, one of the Poetry developers
`suggested <https://discuss.python.org/t/lock-files-again-but-this-time-w-sdists/46593/83>`__
that markers as represented in the package locking approach of this PEP may be
sufficient to cover the needs of Poetry. Not having the installer do a
resolution also simplifies their implementation, centralizing complexity in
lockers.


-----------------------------------------
Requiring minimum hash algorithm support
-----------------------------------------

It was proposed to require a baseline hash algorithm for the files. This was
rejected as no other Python packaging specification requires specific hash
algorithm support. As well, the minimum hash algorithm suggested may eventually
become an outdated/unsafe suggestion, requiring further updates. In order to
promote using the best algorithm at all times, no baseline is provided to avoid
simply defaulting to the baseline in tools without considering the security
ramifications of that hash algorithm.


-----------
File naming
-----------

Using ``*.pylock.toml`` as the file name
========================================

It was proposed to put the ``pylock`` constant part of the file name after the
identifier for the purpose of the lock file. It was decided not to do this so
that lock files would sort together when looking at directory contents instead
of purely based on their purpose which could spread them out in a directory.


Using ``*.pylock`` as the file name
===================================

Not using ``.toml`` as the file extension and instead making it ``.pylock``
itself was proposed. This was decided against so that code editors would know
how to provide syntax highlighting to a lock file without having special
knowledge about the file extension.


Not having a naming convention for the file
===========================================

Having no requirements or guidance for a lock file's name was considered, but
ultimately rejected. By having a standardized naming convention it makes it easy
to identify a lock file for both a human and a code editor. This helps
facilitate discovery when e.g. a tool wants to know all of the lock files that
are available.


-----------
File format
-----------

Use JSON over TOML
==================

Since having a format that is machine-writable was a goal of this PEP, it was
suggested to use JSON. But it was deemed less human-readable than TOML while
not improving on the machine-writable aspect enough to warrant the change.


Use YAML over TOML
==================

Some argued that YAML met the machine-writable/human-readable requirement in a
better way than TOML. But as that's subjective and ``pyproject.toml`` already
existed as the human-writable file used by Python packaging standards it was
deemed more important to keep using TOML.


----------
Other keys
----------

A single hash algorithm for the whole file
==========================================

Earlier versions of this PEP proposed having a single hash algorithm be
specified per file instead of any number of algorithms per file. The thinking
was that by specifying a single algorithm it would help with auditing the file
when a specific hash algorithm was mandated for use.

In the end there was some objection to this idea. Typically, it centered around
the cost of rehashing large wheel files (e.g. PyTorch). There was also concern
about making hashing decisions upfront on the installer's behalf which they may
disagree with. In the end it was deemed better to have flexibility and let
people audit the lock file as they see fit.


Hashing the contents of the lock file itself
============================================

Hashing the contents of the bytes of the file and storing hash value within the
file itself was proposed at some point. This was removed to make it easier
when merging changes to the lock file as each merge would have to recalculate
the hash value to avoid a merge conflict.

Hashing the semantic contents of the file was also proposed, but it would lead
to the same merge conflict issue.

Regardless of which contents were hashed, either approach could have the hash
value stored outside of the file if such a hash was desired.


Recording the creation date of the lock file
============================================

To know how potentially stale the lock file was, an earlier proposal suggested
recording the creation date of the lock file. But for some same merge conflict
reasons as storing the hash of the file contents, this idea was dropped.


Recording the package indexes used in searching
===============================================

Recording what package indexes were used to create the lock file was considered.
In the end, though, it was rejected as it was deemed unnecessary bookkeeping.


Locking build requirements for sdists
=====================================

An earlier version of this PEP tried to lock the build requirements for sdists
under a ``packages.build-requires`` key. Unfortunately, it confused enough people
about how it was expected to operate and there were enough edge case issues to
decide it wasn't worth trying to do in this PEP upfront. Instead, a future PEP
could propose a solution.


Recording possible extras and dependency groups
===============================================

To expand the feature set of this PEP such that tools could use this PEP for
their main lock file format, recording possible extras and dependency groups
that a user may request was considered. The idea was that if you were locking
from a ``pyproject.toml`` file then you would want to lock for all
possibilities; that includes extras and dependency groups.

To make this work one would need a way to declare when a package applied to an
extra and/or dependency group. Due to the possibility that a combination of
extras and/or dependency groups could change version requirements of a package
(e.g. extra A needed the spam package at any version, but extra B needed the
spam package older than version 2, thus making whether extra B was requested
override what extra A requested), it would require either full Boolean logic
support or only locking to a specific version of a package no matter what extras
and/or dependency groups were requested. The former would at least require
coming up with semantics around a marker for dependency groups, and the latter
would require a separate lock file any time one didn't want a single version
restriction.

In the end, there wasn't enough interest from tools for using this PEP as
their sole lock file format to warrant doing the work to implement this feature
at this time.


--------------
Simplification
--------------

Drop recording the package version
==================================

The package version is optional since it can only be reliably recorded when an
sdist of wheel file is used. And since both sources record the version in file
names it is technically redundant.

But in discussions it was decided the version number is useful for auditing
enough to still state it separately.


Drop the requirement to specify the location of an sdist and/or wheels
======================================================================

At least one person has commented how their work has unstable URLs for all
sdists and wheels. As such, they have to search for all files at install
regardless of where the file was found previously. Dropping the requirement to
provide the URL or path to a file would have helped solve the issue of recording
known-bad information.

The decision to allow tools to look for a file in other ways beyond the URL
provided alleviated the need to make the URL optional.


Drop requiring file size and hashes
===================================

At least one person has said that their work modifies all wheels and sdists with
internal files. That means any recorded hashes and file sizes will be wrong. By
making the file size and hashes optional -- very likely through some opt-out
mechanism -- then they could continue to produce lock files that meet this PEP's
requirements.

The decision was made that this weakens security too much. It also prevents
installing files from alternative locations.


Drop recording the sdist file name
==================================

While incompatible with dropping the URL/path requirement, the package
version, and hashes, recording the sdist file name is technically not necessary
at all (right now recording the file name is optional). The file name only
encodes the project name and version, so no new info is conveyed about the file
(when the package version is provided). And if the location is recorded then
getting the file is handled regardless of the file name.

But recording the file name can helpful when looking for an appropriate file
when the recorded file location is no longer available (while sdist file names
are now standardized thanks to :pep:`625`, that has only been true since 2020
and thus there are many older sdists with names that may not be guessable).

The decision was made to require the sdist file name out of simplicity.


Make ``packages.wheels`` a table
=================================

One could see writing out wheel file details as a table keyed on the file name.
For example:

.. code-block:: TOML

  [[packages]]
  name = "attrs"
  version = "23.2.0"
  requires-python = ">=3.7"
  index = "https://pypi.org/simple/"

In general, though, people did not prefer this over the approach this PEP has
taken.


----------------
Self-Referential
----------------

Drop the ``[tool]`` table
=========================

The ``[tool]`` table is included as it has been found to be very useful for
``pyproject.toml`` files. Providing similar flexibility to this PEP is done in
hopes that similar benefits will materialize.

But some people have been concerned that such a table will be too enticing to
tools and will lead to files that are tool-specific and unusable by other
tools. This could cause issues for tools trying to do installation, auditing,
etc. as they would not know what details in the ``[tool]`` table are somehow
critical.

As a compromise, this PEP specifies that the details recorded in ``[tool]`` must
be disposable and not affect installation of packages.


List the requirement inputs for the file
========================================

Right now the file does not record the requirements that acted as inputs to the
file. This is for simplicity reasons and to not explicitly constrain the file
in some unforeseen way (e.g., updating the file after initial creation for a
new platform that has different requirements, all without having to resolve
how to write a comprehensive set of requirements).

But it may help in auditing and any recreation of the file if the original
requirements were somehow recorded. This could be a single string or an array
of strings if multiple requirements were used with the file.

In the end it was deemed too complicated to try and capture the inputs
that a tool used to construct the lock file in a generic fashion.

Auditing

Recording dependents
====================

Recording the dependents of a package is not necessary to install it. As such,
it has been left out of the PEP as it can be included via ``[tool]``.

But knowing how critical a package is to other packages may be beneficial. This
information is included by `pip-tools`_ , so there's prior art in including it.
A flexible approach could be used to record the dependents, e.g. as much
detail as to differentiate from any other entry for the same package in the file
(inspired by uv_).

In the end, though, it was decided that recording the dependencies is a better
thing to record.
