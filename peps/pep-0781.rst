Status: Draft
Type: Standards Track
Topic: Typing
Created: 24-Mar-2025
Python-Version: 3.14


Abstract
========

This PEP proposes adding a new keyword ``__type_checking__`` that serves the
same purpose as :data:`typing.TYPE_CHECKING`.
This constant is ``True`` when the code is being analyzed by a static type
checker, and ``False`` during normal runtime execution.


Motivation
==========

For libraries that may be used in scripts where startup time is critical,
the time taken to import the ``typing`` module cannot be ignored.

To avoid importing ``typing``, developers currently define a module-level
variable ``TYPE_CHECKING = False`` or use code like
``if False:  # TYPE_CHECKING``.
Providing a standard method will allow many tools to implement the same
behavior consistently.

Furthermore, this allows compilers to eliminate type-checking-only code at
compile time. This reduces bytecode size and memory usage,
and would help with writing type-hinted code for memory-constrained
environments like WASM or micropython.


Specification
=============

``__type_checking__`` is a :ref:`keyword <python:keywords>` and its value is
``False``.
It can be used in the same way as ``False``, except it can not be used as
a matching pattern.

Similar to :data:`typing.TYPE_CHECKING`, type checking tools should treat
``__type_checking__`` as ``True``.


Rationale
=========

Difference from ``__debug__``
-----------------------------

:data:`__debug__` is not a keyword, but a built-in constant.
Not adding a new keyword is attractive, but it requires special handling in
both the compiler and the runtime to change the value of the constant
depending on the startup option.

By implementing ``__type_checking__`` the same way as ``False``,
we avoid the need for special handling in both the compiler and runtime.
Therefore, making it a keyword is the simpler approach.


How to teach this
=================

Add this note to the ``typing.TYPE_CHECKING`` document:

> If you don't want to import ``typing``, you can use ``__type_checking__``.
> Workarounds like ``TYPE_CHECKING = False`` or
> ``if False:  # TYPE_CHECKING`` are not recommended since Python 3.14.
