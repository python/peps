Abstract
========

This PEP proposes a way to type extra fields for :class:`~typing.TypedDict`.
This addresses the need to define a subset of fields that might appear in a
``dict`` while permitting additional fields of a specified type.

Motivation
==========

:pep:`589` specified a tight restriction on type checking the construction of a TypedDict::

    class MovieBase(TypedDict):
        name: str

    movie: MovieBase = {"name": "Blade Runner", "year": 1982}  # Not OK

While the restriction is enforced when constructing a TypedDict, due to
structural subtyping, the TypedDict is flexible enough to have extra fields that
are not visible through its type. For example::

    class Movie(MovieBase):
        year: int

    def f(movie: MovieBase) -> None:
        # movie can have extra fields that are not visible through MovieBase
        ...

    movie: Movie = {"name": "Blade Runner", "year": 1982}
    f(movie)  # OK

It is not possible to acknowledge the existence of the extra fields through
``in`` check and access them without breaking type safety, even though they
might exist from arbitrary structural subtypes of ``MovieBase``::

    def g(movie: MovieBase) -> None:
        if "year" in movie:
            reveal_type(movie["year"])  # Error: TypedDict 'MovieBase' has no key 'breed'

There have been requests to disallow extra keys explicitly by defining a "final" TypedDict
type [1]_ [2]_. There are also requests to allow extra keys for TypedDict [3]_ [4]_,
which is needed when typing a subset of possible keys in complex dictionaries.
The following are some existing workarounds:

- Suppress type checking error specifically for unknown keys on TypedDict. For
  mypy, this can be done with ``--disable-error-code=typeddict-unknown-key``
  [5]_. This sacrifices type safety over flexibility, and it does not offer a
  way to restrict the type of additional fields on a TypedDict.

- Define the extra keys as a nested ``Dict`` or ``Mapping`` inside the
  ``TypedDict``::

      class MovieBase(TypedDict):
          name: str
          extra_fields: Mapping[str, int | str]
  
  While this construct is explicit about the type of the extra fields, it cannot
  preserve the structure of an otherwise flatter dictionary containing all the
  extra fields, adding an extra level of nesting. This is also undesirable when
  the TypedDict ought to be used with an external API where the structure is
  already defined.

- Define a subclass of ``MutableMapping`` and override ``__getitem__`` for
  specific string literals::

    class Movie(MutableMapping[str, int | str]):
        @overload
        def __getitem__(self, key: Literal['name']) -> str:
            ...

  This requires a lot of boilerplate code and is harder to read than a plain
  TypedDict does not work to precisely type construction or mutation of a
  specific field.

:pep:`692` adds a way to precisely annotate the types of individual keyword
arguments represented by ``**kwargs`` using TypedDict with ``Unpack``. However,
because TypedDict cannot be defined to accept arbitrary extra fields, it is not
possible to allow additional keyword arguments that are not known at the time
the TypedDict is defined.

Given the usage of pre-:pep:`692` type annotation for ``**kwargs`` in existing
codebases, it will be valuable to accept and type extra fields on TypedDict so
that the old typing behavior can be supported in combination with the new
``Unpack`` construct. [6]_

Rationale
=========

A type that allows extra fields of type ``str`` on a TypedDict can be loosely
described as the intersection between the TypedDict and ``Mapping[str, str]``.

`Index Signatures <https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/objects.html#index-signatures>`__
in TypeScript achieve this:

.. code-block:: typescript

    type Foo = {
        a: string
        [key: string]: string
    }

This proposal aims to support a similar feature without introducing general
intersection of types or syntax changes.

We propose that we give the dunder attribute ``__extra__`` a special meaning:
When it is defined on a TypedDict type, extra fields are allowed, and their
types should be compatible with the type of ``__extra__``. Different from index
signatures, the types of known fields don't need to be consistent with the type
of ``__extra__``.

There are some advantages to this approach:

- Inheritance works naturally. ``__extra__`` defined on a TypedDict will also
  be available to its subclasses.

- We can build on top of
  :pep:`the type consistency rules defined in PEP 589 <589#type-consistency>`.
  ``__extra__`` can be treated as a pseudo-key in terms of type consistency.

- There is no need to introduce a syntax to specify the type of the extra
  fields.

- We can precisely type the extra fields without making ``__extra__`` the union
  of known fields.

Specification
=============

This specification is structured to parallel :pep:`589` to highlight changes to
the original TypedDict specification.

Extra fields are treated as non-required fields having the same type of
``__extra__`` whose keys are allowed when determining
:pep:`supported and unsupported operations <589>`.

Using TypedDict Types
---------------------

For a TypedDict type that has the ``__extra__`` field, during construction, the
value type of each unknown field is expected to be non-required and compatible
with the type of ``__extra__``. For example::

    class Movie(TypedDict):
        name: str
        __extra__: bool
    
    a: Movie = {"name": "Blade Runner", "novel_adaptation": True}  # OK
    b: Movie = {
        "name": "Blade Runner",
        "year": 1982,  # Not OK. 'int' is incompatible with 'bool'
    }  

In this example, ``__extra__: bool`` does not mean that ``Movie`` has a required
string key "__extra__" whose value type is ``bool``. Instead, it specifies that
fields other than "name" have a value type of ``bool`` and are non-required.

The alternative inline syntax is also supported::

    Movie = TypedDict("Movie", {"name": str, "__extra__": bool})

Accessing extra fields is allowed. Type checkers must infer its value type from
the type of ``__extra__``::

    def f(movie: Movie, key: str) -> None:
        reveal_type(movie["name"])  # Revealed type is 'str'
        reveal_type(movie["year"])  # Revealed type is 'int'


Interaction with Totality
-------------------------

It is an error to use ``Required[]`` or ``NotRequired[]`` with the special
``__extra__`` field. ``total=False`` and ``total=True`` have no effect on
``__extra__`` itself.

The extra fields are non-required, regardless of the totality of the TypedDict.
Operations that are available to ``NotRequired`` fields should also be available
to the extra fields::

    def f(movie: Movie) -> None:
        del movie["name"]  # Not OK
        del movie["year"]  # OK

Interaction with ``Unpack``
---------------------------

For type checking purposes, ``Unpack[TypedDict]`` with extra fields should be
treated as its equivalent in regular parameters, and the existing rules for
function parameters still apply::

    class Movie(TypedDict):
        name: str
        __extra__: int
    
    def f(**kwargs: Unpack[Movie]) -> None: ...

    # Should be equivalent to
    def f(*, name: str, **kwargs: int) -> None: ...

Inheritance
-----------

``__extra__`` is inherited the same way as a regular ``key: value_type``
field. The same rules from :pep:`PEP 589 <589#inheritance>` apply.

Additionally, we need to reinterpret the following rule to define how
``__extra__`` interacts with it:

    * Changing a field type of a parent TypedDict class in a subclass is not allowed.

First, it is not allowed to change the type of ``__extra__`` in a subclass::

    class Parent(TypedDict):
        __extra__: int | None
    
    class Child(Parent):
        __extra__: int  # Not OK. Like any other TypedDict field, __extra__'s type cannot be changed

Second, ``__extra__`` effectively defines the type of any unnamed fields
accepted to the TypedDict and marks them as non-required. Thus, the above
restriction applies to any additional fields defined in a subclass. For each
field added in a subclass, all of the following conditions should apply:

- The field is non-required

- The field's value type is consistent with the type of ``__extra__``

- The type of ``__extra__`` is consistent with the field's value type

For example::

    class MovieBase(TypedDict):
        name: str
        __extra__: int | None
    
    class AdaptedMovie(MovieBase):  # Not OK. 'bool' is not consistent with 'int | None'
        adapted_from_novel: bool
 
    class MovieRequiredYear(MovieBase):  # Not OK. Required key 'year' is not known to 'Parent'
        year: int | None

    class MovieNotRequiredYear(MovieBase):  # Not OK. 'int | None' is not consistent with 'int'
        year: NotRequired[int]

    class MovieWithYear(MovieBase):  # OK
        year: NotRequired[int | None]

Due to this nature, an important side effect allows us to define a TypedDict
type that acts similarly to decorating the class definition with ``@final``::

    class MovieFinal(TypedDict):
        name: str
        __extra__: Never

Here, annotating ``__extra__`` with :class:`typing.Never` prevents ``MovieFinal``
from being inheritted, because existing fields' types cannot be changed and
no meaningful extra fields can be added.

Type Consistency
----------------

In addition to the set ``S`` of keys of the explicitly defined fields, a
TypedDict type that has ``__extra__`` is considered to have an infinite set of
fields that all satisfy the following conditions:

- The field is non-required

- The field's value type is consistent with the type of ``__extra__``

- The type of ``__extra__`` is consistent with the field's value type

- The field's key is not in ``S``.

For type checking purposes, let "__extra__" be a pseudo-key to be included
whenever "for each key" or "for each non-required key" is stated in
:pep:`the existing type consistency rules <589#type-consistency>`:

    Second, a TypedDict type ``A`` is consistent with TypedDict ``B`` if
    ``A`` is structurally compatible with ``B``.  This is true if and only
    if both of these conditions are satisfied:

    * For each key in ``B``, ``A`` has the corresponding key and the
      corresponding value type in ``A`` is consistent with the value type in
      ``B``. For each key in ``B``, the value type in ``B`` is also consistent
      with the corresponding value type in ``A``. [Edit: if the corresponding key
      with the same name cannot be found in ``A``, "__extra__" is considered the
      corresponding key.]

    * For each required key in ``B``, the corresponding key is required in
      ``A``.  For each non-required key in ``B``, the corresponding key is not
      required in ``A``. [Edit: if the corresponding non-required key with the
      same name cannot be found in ``A``, "__extra__" is considered the
      corresponding key.]

The following examples illustrate these checks in action.

``__extra__`` as a pseudo-field follows the same rules that other fields have,
so when both TypedDict contains ``__extra__``, this check is naturally
enforced::

    class MovieExtraInt(TypedDict):
        name: str
        __extra__: int

    class MovieExtraStr(TypedDict):
        name: str
        __extra__: str
    
    extra_int: MovieExtraInt = {"name": "No Country for Old Men", "year": 2007}
    extra_str: MovieExtraStr = {"name": "No Country for Old Men", "description": ""}
    extra_int = extra_str  # Not OK. 'str' is inconsistent with 'int' for field '__extra__'
    extra_str = extra_int  # Not OK. 'int' is inconsistent with 'str' for field '__extra__'
    
When only one of the TypedDict ``t`` has ``__extra__``, then the keys unknown to
``t`` in the other TypedDict corresponds to the ``__extra__`` pseudo-field.
Still, the same set of rules from :pep:`589` apply::

    class MovieNotRequiredYear(TypedDict):
        name: str
        year: NotRequired[int]
    
    class MovieRequiredYear(TypedDict):
        name: str
        year: int

    extra_int: MovieExtraInt = {"name": "Kill Bill Vol. 1"}
    required_year: MovieNotRequiredYear = {"name": "Kill Bill Vol. 1"}
    not_required_year: MovieRequiredYear = {"name": "Kill Bill Vol. 1", "year": 2003}

    extra_int = required_year  # Not OK. Having an extra required field makes
                               # 'required_year' structurally incompatible with
                               # 'extra_int'
    extra_int = not_required_year  # OK.

    required_year = extra_int  # Not OK. The required key 'year' is missing in
                               # 'extra_int'
    not_required_year = extra_int  # OK.

A TypedDict can be consistent with ``Mapping[...]`` types other than
``Mapping[str, object]`` as long as the union of value types on all fields is
consistent with the value type of the ``Mapping[...]`` type. It is an extension
to this rule::

    * A TypedDict with all ``int`` values is not consistent with
      ``Mapping[str, int]``, since there may be additional non-``int``
      values not visible through the type, due to structural subtyping.
      These can be accessed using the ``values()`` and ``items()``
      methods in ``Mapping``

For example::

    extra_str: MovieExtraStr = {"name": "Blade Runner", "summary": ""}
    str_mapping: Mapping[str, str] = extra_str  # OK

    int_mapping: Mapping[str, int] = extra_int  # Not OK. 'int | str' is not consistent with 'int'
    int_str_mapping: Mapping[str, int | str] = extra_int  # OK

Note that because the presence of ``__extra__`` prohibits required keys from
being added through inheritance, it is possible to determine if a TypedDict type
and its structural subtypes will never have any required key during static
analysis.

If there is no required key, the TypedDict type is consistent with ``Dict[...]``
and vice versa if all fields on the TypedDict type satisfy the following
conditions:

- The value type of the ``Dict[...]`` is consistent with the value type of the
  field

- The value type of the field is consistent with the value type of the
  ``Dict[...]``  

For example::

    class IntDict(TypedDict):
        __extra__: int

    class IntDictWithNum(IntDict):
        num: NotRequired[int]

    def f(x: IntDict) -> None:
        v: Dict[str, int] = x  # OK
        v.clear()  # OK
    
    not_required_num: IntDictWithNum = {"num": 1, "bar": 2} 
    regular_dict: Dict[str, int] = not_required_num  # OK
    f(not_required_num)  # OK

Open Issues
===========

Soundness of Structural Subtyping
---------------------------------

We refer to TypeScript's support for this feature in this PEP. However, a caveat
here is that the TypeScript construct is unsound due to a design decision noted
in the documentation [7]_. Consider this example:

.. code-block:: typescript

    interface A {
        value: string
        [key: string]: string | number
    }

    interface B extends A {
        foo: number
    }

    const x: B = {value: "asd", foo: 12}
    function mut(v: A) {
        v.foo = "asd"
    }
    mut(x)
    console.log(x)  // {"value": "asd", "foo": "asd"}

Because ``A`` is a subtype of ``B``, ``mut`` accepts ``x`` and mutates the value
of the property ``foo``, changing it to a ``string``. However, ``x`` is defined
to be ``B``, which expects ``foo`` to be a ``number``. As a result, the value of
``x`` in runtime is no longer consistent with its type during static analysis.

To support this in Python, we need to determine if we need this level of
flexibility to open up this hole of soundness.

This PEP as written is more restrictive to match the type consistency rules
defined in :pep:`589`. A more relaxed design may, for example, no longer
prohibit subclasses of a TypedDict type that defines ``__extra__`` from adding
more required fields::

    class IntDict(TypedDict):
        __extra__: int

    class IntDictWithNum(IntDict):
        num: int

    def f(x: IntDict) -> None:
        del x["num"]  # OK
    
    required_num: IntDictWithNum = {"num": 1}
    f(required_num)  # OK
    required_num["num"]  # KeyError in runtime

Should ``__extra__`` Exclude the Known Keys?
--------------------------------------------

``__extra__`` specifies the value type for fields of keys that are *unknown* to
the TypedDict type. So the value type of any known field is not necessarily
consistent with ``__extra__``'s type, and ``__extra__``'s type is not
necessarily consistent with the value types of all known fields.

This differs from TypeScript's Index Signatures [8]_ syntax, which requires all
properties' types to match the string index's type. For example:

.. code-block:: typescript

    interface MovieWithExtraNumber {
        name: string // Property 'name' of type 'string' is not assignable to 'string' index type 'number'.
        [index: string]: number
    }

    interface MovieWithExtraNumberOrString {
        name: string // OK
        [index: string]: number | string
    }

This is a known limitation is discussed in TypeScript's issue tracker [9]_,
where it is suggested that there should be a way to exclude the defined keys
from the index signature, so that it is possible to define a type like
``MovieWithExtraNumber``.

A workaround is to use intersection:

.. code-block:: typescript

    interface MovieExtras {
        [index: string]: number
    }

    interface MovieBase {
        name: string
    }

    type Movie = MovieExtras & MovieBase

However, this does not work for assignment:

.. code-block:: typescript

    const movie: Movie = {
        name: "No Country for Old Men", // Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'
        year: 2007,
    }

How Else Will This Interact with PEP 692?
-----------------------------------------

Quoting from a comment on a Pull Request that implements part of :pep:`692` [10]_
in mypy, we want it to be as simple as possible, reusing the existing type
checking logic:

    There is nothing cumbersome in reducing the PEP to just one paragraph that
    would explain that `Unpack[SomeTD]` is a syntactic sugar for (and is
    considered equivalent to) the expanded signature. This has a number of
    benefits:

    * This will not add any new unsafety that is not already present for
      existing uses of TypedDicts in `**` contexts. (And type checkers may
      handle this unsafety in a uniform way, say in mypy we _may_ use existing
      `--extra-checks` flag to prohibit some techincally unsafe calls as I
      mentioned before.)

    * This is actually easy to remember and to reason about.

    * This will allow people who want subtyping between callables to easily
      achieve this using `total=False`, which follows from existing rules for
      expanded callables.

Backwards Compatibility
=======================

Dunder attributes like ``__extra__`` are reserved for stdlib, we need not
concerned about using it in this proposal. If the proposal is accepted, neither
``__required_keys__`` and ``__optional_keys__`` should include ``__extra__`` in
runtime.

Because this is a type-checking feature, it can be made available to older
versions as long as the type checker supports it without requiring imports from
``typing_extensions``.

Rejected Ideas
==============

Allowing Extra Fields without Specifying the Type
-------------------------------------------------

``extra=True`` was originally proposed for defining a TypedDict accept extra
fields regardless of the type, like how ``total=True`` works::

    class TypedDict(extra=True):
        pass

Because it did not offer a way to specify the type of the extra fields, the type
checkers will need to assume that the type of the extra fields are ``Any``,
which compromises type safety. Furthermore, the current behavior of TypedDict
already allows untyped extra fields to be present in runtime, due to structural
subtyping.

Supporting ``TypedDict(extra=type)``
------------------------------------

This adds more corner cases to determine whether a type should be treated as a
type or a value. And it will require more work to support using special forms to
type the extra fields.

While this saves us from reserving an attribute for special use, it will require
extra work to implement inheritance, and it is less natural to integrate with
generic TypedDicts.

Support Extra Fields with Intersection
--------------------------------------

Supporting intersections in Python's type system requires a lot of careful
considerations, and it can take a long time for the community to reach a
consensus on a reasonable design.

Ideally, extra fields in TypedDict should not be blocked by work on
intersections, nor does it necessarily need to be supported through
intersections.

Moreover, the intersection between ``Mapping[...]`` and ``TypedDict`` is not
equivalent to a TypedDict type with the proposed ``__extra__`` special field, as
the value type of all known fields in ``TypedDict`` need to satisfy the
is-subtype-of relation with the value type of ``Mapping[...]``.

Reference Implementation
========================

pyanalyze has
`experimental support <https://github.com/quora/pyanalyze/blob/9bfc2c58467c87774a9950838402d2657b1486a0/pyanalyze/extensions.py#L590>`__
for a similar feature.

Reference implementation for this specific proposal, however, is not currently available.
