PEP: 271
Title: Prefixing sys.path by command line option
Author: Frédéric B. Giacometti <fred@arakne.com>
Status: Rejected
Type: Standards Track
Created: 15-Aug-2001
Python-Version: 2.2
Post-History:


Abstract
========

At present, setting the ``PYTHONPATH`` environment variable is the
only method for defining additional Python module search
directories.

This PEP introduces the '-P' valued option to the python command
as an alternative to ``PYTHONPATH``.


Rationale
=========

On Unix::

    python -P $SOMEVALUE

will be equivalent to::

   env PYTHONPATH=$SOMEVALUE python

On Windows 2K::

    python -P %SOMEVALUE%

will (almost) be equivalent to::

   set __PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH% && set PYTHONPATH=%SOMEVALUE%\
      && python && set PYTHONPATH=%__PYTHONPATH%


Other Information
=================

This option is equivalent to the 'java -classpath' option.


When to use this option
=======================

This option is intended to ease and make more robust the use of
Python in test or build scripts, for instance.


Reference Implementation
========================

A patch implementing this is available from SourceForge::
