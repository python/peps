Abstract
========

As :pep:`654` :class:`ExceptionGroup` has come into widespread use across the
Python community, some common but awkward patterns have emerged. We therefore
propose adding two new methods to exception objects:

- :meth:`!BaseExceptionGroup.flat_exceptions`, returning the 'leaf' exceptions as
  a list, with each traceback composited from any intermediate groups.

- :meth:`!BaseException.preserve_context`, a context manager which
  saves and restores the :attr:`!self.__context__` attribute of ``self``,
  so that raising the exception within an ``except:`` block.

We expect this to enable more concise expression of error handling logic in
many medium-complexity cases. Without them, exception-group handlers will
continue to discard intermediate tracebacks and mis-handle ``__context__``
exceptions, to the detriment of anyone debugging async code.


Motivation
==========

As exception groups come into widespread use, library authors and end users
often write code to process or respond to individual leaf exceptions, for
example when implementing middleware, error logging, or response handlers in
a web framework.

`Searching GitHub`__ found four implementations of :meth:`!flat_exceptions` by
various names in the first sixty hits, of which none handle
tracebacks.\ [#numbers]_  The same search found thirteen cases where
:meth:`!.flat_exceptions` could be used.  We therefore believe that providing
a method on the :class:`BaseException` type with proper traceback preservation
will improve error-handling and debugging experiences across the ecosystem.

__ https://github.com/search?q=%2Ffor+%5Cw%2B+in+%5Beg%5D%5Cw*%5C.exceptions%3A%2F+language%3APython&type=code

The rise of exception groups has also made re-raising exceptions caught by an
earlier handler much more common: for example, web-server middleware might
unwrap ``HTTPException`` if that is the sole leaf of a group:

.. code-block:: python

    except* HTTPException as group:
        first, *rest = group.flat_exceptions()  # get the whole traceback :-)
        if not rest:
            raise first
        raise

However, this innocent-seeming code has a problem: ``raise first`` will do
``first.__context__ = group`` as a side effect. This discards the original
context of the error, which may contain crucial information to understand why
the exception was raised. In many production apps it also causes tracebacks
to balloon from hundreds of lines, to tens or even `hundreds of thousands of
lines`__ - a volume which makes understanding errors far more difficult than
it should be.

A new :meth:`!BaseException.preserve_context` method would be a discoverable,
readable, and easy-to-use solution for these cases.


Specification
=============

A new method ``flat_exceptions()`` will be added to ``BaseExceptionGroup``, with the
following signature:

.. code-block:: python

    def flat_exceptions(self, *, fix_tracebacks=True) -> list[BaseException]:
        """
        Return a flat list of all 'leaf' exceptions in the group.

        If fix_tracebacks is True, each leaf will have the traceback replaced
        with a composite so that frames attached to intermediate groups are
        still visible when debugging. Pass fix_tracebacks=False to disable
        this modification, e.g. if you expect to raise the group unchanged.
        """

A new method ``preserve_context()`` will be added to ``BaseException``, with the
following signature:

.. code-block:: python

    def preserve_context(self) -> contextlib.AbstractContextManager[Self]:
        """
        Context manager that preserves the exception's __context__ attribute.

        When entering the context, the current values of __context__ is saved.
        When exiting, the saved value is restored, which allows raising an
        exception inside an except block without changing its context chain.
        """

Usage example:

.. code-block:: python

    # We're an async web framework, where user code can raise an HTTPException
    # to return a particular HTTP error code to the client. However, it may
    # (or may not) be raised inside a TaskGroup, so we need to use `except*`;
    # and if there are *multiple* such exceptions we'll treat that as a bug.
    try:
        user_code_here()
    except* HTTPException as group:
        first, *rest = group.flat_exceptions()
        if rest:
            raise  # handled by internal-server-error middleware
        ... # logging, cache updates, etc.
        with first.preserve_context():
            raise first

Without ``.preserve_context()``, this could would have to either:

* arrange for the exception to be raised *after* the ``except*`` block,
  making code difficult to follow in nontrivial cases, or
* discard the existing ``__context__`` of the ``first`` exception, replacing
  it with an ``ExceptionGroup`` which is simply an implementation detail, or
* use ``try/except`` instead of ``except*``, handling the possibility that
  the group doesn't contain an ``HTTPException`` at all,[#catch-raw-group]_ or
* implement the semantics of ``.preserve_context()`` inline::

    prev_ctx = first.__context__
    try:
        raise first  # or `raise first from None`, etc.
    finally:
        first.__context__ = prev_ctx
        del prev_ctx  # break gc cycle

  which is not *literally unheard-of*, but remains very very rare.


Backwards Compatibility
=======================

Adding new methods to built-in classes, especially those as widely used as
``BaseException``, can have substantial impacts. However, GitHub search shows
no collisions for these method names (`zero hits <flat-exceptions>`_ and
`three unrelated hits <preserve-context>`_ respectively). If user-defined
methods with these names exist in private code they will shadow those proposed
in the PEP, without changing runtime behavior.

.. _flat-exceptions: https://github.com/search?q=%2F%5C.flat_exceptions%5C%28%2F+language%3APython&type=code
.. _preserve-context: https://github.com/search?q=%2F%5C.preserve_context%5C%28%2F+language%3APython&type=code


How to Teach This
=================

Working with exception groups is an intermediate-to-advanced topic, unlikely
to arise for beginning programmers. We therefore suggest teaching this topic
via documentation, and via just-in-time feedback from static analysis tools.
In intermediate classes, we recommend teaching ``.flat_exceptions()`` together
with the ``.split()`` and ``.subgroup()`` methods, and mentioning
``.preserve_context()`` as an advanced option to address specific pain points.

Both the API reference and the existing `ExceptionGroup tutorial
<https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#exception-groups>`_ should
be updated to demonstrate and explain the new methods. The tutorial should
include examples of common patterns where ``.flat_exceptions()`` and
``.preserve_context()`` help simplify error handling logic. Downstream
libraries which often use exception groups could include similar docs.

We have also designed lint rules for inclusion in ``flake8-async`` which will
suggest using ``.flat_exceptions()`` when iterating over ``group.exceptions``
or re-raising a leaf exception, and suggest using ``.preserve_context()`` when
re-raising a leaf exception inside an ``except*`` block would override any
existing context.


Reference Implementation
========================

While the methods on built-in exceptions will be implemented in C if this PEP
is accepted, we hope that the following Python implementation will be useful
on older versions of Python, and can demonstrate the intended semantics.

We have found these helper functions quite useful when working with
:class:`ExceptionGroup`\ s in a large production codebase.

A ``flat_exceptions()`` helper function
---------------------------------------

.. code-block:: python

    import copy
    import types
    from types import TracebackType


    def flat_exceptions(
        self: BaseExceptionGroup, *, fix_traceback: bool = True
    ) -> list[BaseException]:
        """
        Return a flat list of all 'leaf' exceptions.

        If fix_tracebacks is True, each leaf will have the traceback replaced
        with a composite so that frames attached to intermediate groups are
        still visible when debugging. Pass fix_tracebacks=False to disable
        this modification, e.g. if you expect to raise the group unchanged.
        """

        def _flatten(group: BaseExceptionGroup, parent_tb: TracebackType | None = None):
            group_tb = group.__traceback__
            combined_tb = _combine_tracebacks(parent_tb, group_tb)
            result = []
            for exc in group.exceptions:
                if isinstance(exc, BaseExceptionGroup):
                    result.extend(_flatten(exc, combined_tb))
                elif fix_tracebacks:
                    tb = _combine_tracebacks(combined_tb, exc.__traceback__)
                    result.append(exc.with_traceback(tb))
                else:
                    result.append(exc)
            return result

        return _flatten(self)


    def _combine_tracebacks(
        tb1: TracebackType | None,
        tb2: TracebackType | None,
    ) -> TracebackType | None:
        """
        Combine two tracebacks, putting tb1 frames before tb2 frames.

        If either is None, return the other.
        """
        if tb1 is None:
            return tb2
        if tb2 is None:
            return tb1

        # Convert tb1 to a list of frames
        frames = []
        current = tb1
        while current is not None:
            frames.append((current.tb_frame, current.tb_lasti, current.tb_lineno))
            current = current.tb_next

        # Create a new traceback starting with tb2
        new_tb = tb2

        # Add frames from tb1 to the beginning (in reverse order)
        for frame, lasti, lineno in reversed(frames):
            new_tb = types.TracebackType(
                tb_next=new_tb, tb_frame=frame, tb_lasti=lasti, tb_lineno=lineno
            )

        return new_tb


A ``preserve_context()`` context manager
----------------------------------------

.. code-block:: python

    class preserve_context:
        def __init__(self, exc: BaseException):
            self.__exc = exc
            self.__context = exc.__context__

        def __enter__(self):
            return self.__exc

        def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
            assert exc_value is self.__exc, f"did not raise the expected exception {self.__exc!r}"
            exc_value.__context__ = self.__context
            del self.__context  # break gc cycle


Rejected Ideas
==============

Add utility functions instead of methods
----------------------------------------

Rather than adding methods to exceptions, we could provide utility functions
like the reference implementations above.

There are however several reasons to prefer methods: there's no obvious place
where helper functions should live, they take exactly one argument which must
be an instance of ``BaseException``, and methods are both more convenient and
more discoverable.


Add ``BaseException.as_group()`` (or group methods)
---------------------------------------------------

Our survey of ``ExceptionGroup``-related error handling code also observed
many cases of duplicated logic to handle both a bare exception, and the same
kind of exception inside a group (often incorrectly, motivating
``.flat_exceptions()``).

We briefly `proposed <https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/125825>`__
adding ``.split(...)`` and ``.subgroup(...)`` methods too all exceptions,
before considering ``.flat_exceptions()`` made us feel this was too clumsy.
As a cleaner alternative, we sketched out an ``.as_group()`` method:

.. code-block:: python

    def as_group(self):
        if not isinstance(self, BaseExceptionGroup):
            return BaseExceptionGroup("", [self])
        return self

However, applying this method to refactor existing code was a negligible
improvement over writing the trivial inline version. We also hope that many
current uses for such a method will be addressed by ``except*`` as older
Python versions reach end-of-life.

We recommend documenting a "convert to group" recipe for de-duplicated error
handling, instead of adding group-related methods to ``BaseException``.


Add ``e.raise_with_preserved_context()`` instead of a context manager
---------------------------------------------------------------------

We prefer the context-manager form because it allows ``raise ... from ...``
if the user wishes to (re)set the ``__cause__``, and is overall somewhat
less magical and tempting to use in cases where it would not be appropriate.
We could be argued around though, if others prefer this form.

    <https://github.com/search?q=%2Ffor+%5Cw%2B+in+%5Beg%5D%5Cw*%5C.exceptions%3A%2F+language%3APython&type=code>`__
    for ``for \w+ in [eg]\w*\.exceptions:``, we find:

    * Four functions implementing ``flat_exceptions()`` semantics, none of
      which preserve tracebacks:
      (`one <https://github.com/nonebot/nonebot2/blob/570bd9587af99dd01a7d5421d3105d8a8e2aba32/nonebot/utils.py#L259-L266>`__,

    * Six handlers which raise the first exception in a group, discarding
      any subsequent errors; these would benefit from both proposed methods.
      (`one <https://github.com/Lancetnik/FastDepends/blob/239cd1a58028782a676934f7d420fbecf5cb6851/fast_depends/core/model.py#L488-L490>`__,

    * Seven cases which mishandle nested exception groups, and would thus
      benefit from ``flat_exceptions()``. We were surprised to note that only
      one of these cases could straightforwardly be replaced by use of an
      ``except*`` clause or ``.subgroup()`` method.
      (`one <https://github.com/vertexproject/synapse/blob/ed8148abb857d4445d727768d4c57f4f11b0d20a/synapse/lib/stormlib/iters.py#L82-L88>`__,

    indicating that more than a quarter of _all_ hits for this fairly general
    search would benefit from the methods proposed in this PEP.

.. [#catch-raw-group]
    This remains very rare, and most cases duplicate logic across
    ``except FooError:`` and ``except ExceptionGroup:  # containing FooError``
    clauses rather than using something like the as_group trick.
    We expect that ``except*`` will be widely used in such cases, before
    the methods proposed by this PEP are widely available.
