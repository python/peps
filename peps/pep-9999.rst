Abstract
========

:pep:`508` specifies a mini-language for
declaring package dependencies. One feature of this language is the ability to
specify *extras*, which are optional components of a distribution that, when
used, install additional dependencies. This PEP proposes a mechanism to allow
one or more extras to be installed by default if none are provided explicitly.

Motivation
==========

Various use cases for default extras and possible solutions in this PEP were discussed
extensively on `this DPO thread <https://discuss.python.org/t/adding-a-default-extra-require-environment/4898/38>`__.
These fall into two broad cases that that provide the
motivation for the present PEP.

Recommended but not required dependencies
-----------------------------------------

Package maintainers often use extras to declare optional dependencies that
extend the functionality or performance of a package. In some cases, it can be
difficult to determine which dependencies should be required and which should be
categorized as extras. A balance must be struck between the needs of typical
users (who may prefer most features to be available 'by default') and users who
want minimal installations without large, optional dependencies. One solution
with existing Python packaging infrastructure is for package maintainers to
define an extra called, for example, ``recommended``, which
includes all non-essential but suggested dependencies. Users are then instructed to
install the package using ``package[recommended]``, while those who prefer more
control can use ``package``. However, in practice, many users are unaware
of the ``[recommended]`` syntax, placing the burden on them to know this for a
typical installation. Having a way to have recommended dependencies be installed
by default while providing a way for users to request a more minimal installation
would satisfy this use case. The present PEP will describe a solution for this use case.

Packages supporting multiple backends or frontends
--------------------------------------------------

Another common use case for using extras is to define different backends or
frontends and dependencies that need to be installed for each backend or
frontend. A package might need at least one backend or frontend to be installed
in order to be functional, but may be flexible on which backend or frontend this
is. Concrete examples of such frontends or backends include:

* The Qt frontend library, which requires either PySide or PyQt to be installed
* BLAS/LAPACK, which have different possible implementations (e.g. OpenBLAS, and MKL)
* FFT libraries, which also have different implementations (e.g. ``scipy.fft`` and pyFFTW)

With current packaging standards, maintainers have to either
require one of the backends or frontends, or require users
to always specify extras, e.g. ``package[backend]`` and therefore risk users
having an unusable installation if they only install ``package``. Having a
way to specify one or more default backend or frontend and providing a way to
override these defaults would provide a much better experience for users, and
the approach described in this PEP will allow this.

Note that this PEP does not aim to address the issue of disallowing conflicting
or incompatible extras - for example if a package requires exactly one frontend
or backend package. There is currently no mechanism in Python packaging
infrastructure to disallow conflicting or incompatible extras to be installed,
and this PEP does not change that.

Rationale
=========

A number of possible solutions have been extensively and vigorously discussed by
the community for several years, including in `this DPO thread
<https://discuss.python.org/t/adding-a-default-extra-require-environment/4898/38>`__
as well as in numerous issues and pull requests. The solution that will be
presented below may not be everyone's preferred approach from a philosophical
point of view, however it appears to be the best compromise as it is the only
solution to a very real problem that would not break backward-compatibility of
packaging infrastructure in any significant way. It is an opt-in solution which
means that package maintainers can choose whether or not to use it, and it is
flexible enough to accommodate both of the major use cases described in
`Motivation`_.

Specification
=============

``Default-Extra`` Metadata Field
---------------------------------

A new metadata field, ``Default-Extra``, will be added to the `core package
metadata <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/core-metadata/#core-metadata>`_.
This field allows package maintainers to define an extra that is
automatically included when a user installs the package without specifying any
extras explicitly::

    Default-Extra: recommended

If multiple default extras are needed, one ``Default-Extra:`` entry
should be provided for each one::

    Default-Extra: backend1
    Default-Extra: backend2
    Default-Extra: backend3

New key in ``[project]`` metadata table
---------------------------------------

A new key will be added to the ``[project]`` table in project metadata as
originally defined in :pep:`621` and now defined in the `PyPA specifications
<https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/>`_. This key will be named
``default-optional-dependencies`` with the following description:

* `TOML <https://toml.io/>`_ type: Array of strings
* Corresponding core metadata field: ``Default-Extra``

Each string in ``default-optional-dependencies`` should be the name of an extra
defined in `optional-dependencies
<https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/pyproject-toml/#dependencies-optional-dependencies>`_,
and each extra in this array will be converted to a matching ``Default-Extra``
entry in the core package metadata. Examples of valid usage which would
produce the example ``Default-Extra`` entries presented in the previous section are:

.. code-block:: toml

    [project]
    default-optional-dependencies = [
        "recommended"
    ]

and:

.. code-block:: toml

    [project]
    default-optional-dependencies = [
        "backend1",
        "backend2",
        "backend3"
    ]


Overriding default extras
-------------------------

If extras are explicitly given in a dependency specification, the default
extras are not installed. Otherwise, the default extras are used.

For example, if a package
defines a ``extra1`` default extra as well as a non-default ``extra2``
extra, then if a user was to install the package with::

    pip install package

the ``extra1`` dependency would be included. If the user instead uses::

    pip install package[extra2]

then the ``extra1`` extras would not be installed.

If the same package is specified multiple times in a dependency tree, then if
any of these were specified without any explicit extras, the default extras
should be installed even if other occurrences of the package in the dependency
tree have explicitly specified extras.

Note that ``package[]`` would continue to be equivalent to ``package`` and would
not be provided as a way to install without default extras (see the `Rejected
Ideas`_ section for the rationale).

Installing without default extras
---------------------------------

In some cases, package maintainers may want to facilitate installing packages
without any default extras. In this case, as will be shown in more detail in
`How to teach this`_, the best approach is to define an extras which could be
called e.g. ``minimal`` or ``nodefault`` (the naming would be up to the package
maintainer) which would be an empty set of dependencies. If this extras is
specified, no default extras will be included, so that e.g. ``package[minimal]``
would include only required dependencies and no extras. Note that this requires
no additional specification and is a natural consequence of the rule described
in `Overriding default extras`_.

There are however valid use cases where package maintainers may not want to
provide this. For example, in the case of the multiple possible frontends or
backends, it may be that the package would not be functional without any of the
options. To take a specific example, a package may need either PyQt or PySide to
be installed but will not work if none are provided, so a package maintainer may
therefore not want to provide an option to install the package without any
extras.

Backward Compatibility
======================

All package specification cases valid under :pep:`508` will remain valid.
Therefore, this proposal is fully backward-compatible with existing :pep:`508`
usage.

Once packages start defining default extras, those defaults will only be honored
with recent versions of packaging tools which implement this PEP, but those
packages will remain fully backward-compatible with older packaging tools - with
the only difference that the default extras will not be installed automatically
for older packaging tools.

The only conceptual backward-compatibility issue to consider is the fact that
this PEP changes extras to no longer be strictly additive, in that specifying
an extra such as ``minimal`` could result in fewer packages being installed.

Security Implications
=====================

There are no known security implications for this PEP.

How to teach this
=================

The rule above regarding only installing default extras when no extras
are explicitly specified, combined with the introduction of the
``Default-Extra:`` keyword and ``default-optional-dependencies`` metadata key
allows us to address several different use cases. Below we take a look at the
two specific use cases raised in the `Motivation`_ section and how package
maintainers should be taught to address these.

Recommended dependencies and minimal installations
--------------------------------------------------

First, we consider the case of packages that want recommended
but not strictly required dependencies installed by default, while also
providing a way to only install the required dependencies.

In order to do this, a package maintainer would define an extras called
``recommended`` containing the recommended but not required dependencies, and
would choose to have this be included as a default extras:

.. code-block:: toml

    [project]
    default-optional-dependencies = [
        "recommended"
    ]

    [project.optional-dependencies]
    recommended = [
        "package1",
        "package2"
    ]

In this specific case, a package maintainer may want to allow users to also
install the package without the recommended dependencies, in which case they
could define an empty extras:

.. code-block:: toml

    [project.optional-dependencies]
    minimal = []
    recommended = [
        "package1",
        "package2"
    ]

This would then allow users to install ``package[minimal]`` which, since
there would be an extra explicitly specified, would mean the default extras
does not get installed, and since the ``minimal`` extras is empty, no
additional dependencies would be installed.

Maintainers would have the choice as to whether to offer the capability to do a
minimal installation or not - in some cases, such as highlighted in the next
section, this might not be desirable.

Packages requiring at least one backend or frontend
---------------------------------------------------

As described in `Motivation`_, some packages may support multiple backends
and/or frontends, and in some cases it may be desirable to ensure that there
is always at least one backend or frontend package installed, as the package
would be unusable otherwise. Concrete examples of this might include a GUI
application that needs a GUI library to be present to be usable but is able
to support different ones, or a package that can rely on different computational
backends but needs at least one to be installed.

In this case, package maintainers could make the choice to define an extra
for each backend or frontend, and provide a default, e.g.:

.. code-block:: toml

    [project]
    default-optional-dependencies = [
        "backend1"
    ]

    [project.optional-dependencies]
    backend1 = [
        "package1",
        "package2"
    ]
    backend2 = [
        "package3"
    ]

Unlike the previous example however, maintainers would not necessarily provide a
way to do an installation without any extras since it might leave the package in
an unusable state.

If packages can support e.g. multiple backends at the same time, and some of
the backends should always be installed, then the dependencies for these should be given
as required dependencies rather than using the default extras mechanism.

Supporting minimal installations while not always removing default extras
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

An additional case we consider here is where a package maintainer wants to support
minimal installations without any extras, but also wants to support having users
specify additional extras without removing the default one. Essentially, they
would want:

* ``package[minimal]`` to give an installation without any extras
* ``package`` to install recommended dependencies (in a ``recommended`` extras)
* ``package[additional]`` to install both recommended and additional dependencies (in an ``additional`` extras)

This could be achieved with e.g:

.. code-block:: toml

    [project]
    default-optional-dependencies = [
        "recommended"
    ]

    [project.optional-dependencies]
    minimal = []
    recommended = [
        "package1",
        "package2"
    ]
    additional = [
        "package[recommended]",
        "package3"
    ]

The ability for a package to reference itself in the extras is supported by
existing Python packaging tools.

Teaching package authors
------------------------

Packages making use of any of the approaches above should ensure that they
properly document the options available to users in terms of installation.

Reference Implementation
========================

The following branch contains a modified version of the `flit
<https://flit.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_ package which recognizes the
``default-optional-dependencies`` key in ``pyproject.toml`` and adds the
relevant ``Default-Extra:`` metadata to the build package:

https://github.com/astrofrog/flit/tree/default-extras-pep

In addition, the following branch contains a modified version of `pip
<https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_ which implements the correct logic for
installing extras when default extras are present:

https://github.com/astrofrog/pip/tree/default-extras-pep

Finally, the following repository makes use of the above two branches to
test out different scenarios and use cases described in this PEP:

https://github.com/astrofrog/default-extras-pep-examples

The implementations above are proof-of-concepts at this time, do not include any
tests or documentation in the respective packages, and the existing changes have
not yet been reviewed by the relevant maintainers. Nevertheless, they are
functional enough to allow for interested maintainers to try these out.

Rejected Ideas
==============

Syntax for unselecting extras
-----------------------------

One of the main competing approaches was as follows: instead of having defaults
be unselected if any extras were explicitly provided, default extras would need
to be explicitly unselected.

In this picture, a new syntax for unselecting extras would be introduced as an
extension of the mini-language defined in :pep:`508`. If a package defined
default extras, users could opt out of these defaults by using a minus sign
(``-``) before the extra name. The proposed syntax update would have been as follows::

    extras_list   = (-)?identifier (wsp* ',' wsp* (-)?identifier)*

Valid examples of this new syntax would have included, e.g.:

* ``package[-recommended]``
* ``package[-backend1, backend2]``
* ``package[pdf, -svg]``

However, there are two main issues with this approach:

* One would need to define a number of rules for how to interpret corner cases
  such as if an extras and its negated version were both present in the same
  dependency specification (e.g. ``package[pdf, -pdf]``) or if a dependency
  tree included both ``package[pdf]`` and ``package[-pdf]``, and the rules would
  not be intuitive to users.

* More critically, this would introduce new syntax into dependency specification,
  which means that if any package defined a dependency using the new syntax, it
  and any other package depending on it would no longer be installable by existing
  packaging tools, so this would be a major backward compatibility break.

For these reasons, this alternative was not included in the final proposal.

Adding a special entry in ``extras_require``
--------------------------------------------

A potential solution that has been explored as an alternative to introducing the
new ``Default-Extra`` metadata field would be to make use of an extra with a
'special' name.

One example would be to use an empty string::

    Provides-Extra:
    Requires-Dist: numpy ; extra == ''

The idea would be that dependencies installed as part of the 'empty' extras
would only get installed if another extra was not specified. An implementation
of this was proposed in https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/pull/1503, but it
was found that there would be no way to make this work without breaking
compatibility with existing usage. For example, packages using setuptools via
a ``setup.py`` file can do::

    setup(
        ...
        extras_require={'': ['package_a']},
    )


which is valid and equivalent to having ``package_a`` being defined in
``install_requires``, so changing the meaning of the empty string requires would
break compatibility.

In addition, no other string (such as ``'default'``) can be used as a special
string since all strings that would be a backward-compatible valid extras name
may already be used in existing packages.

There have been suggestions of using the special ``None`` Python variable, but
again this is not possible, because even though one can use ``None`` in a ``setup.py`` file,
this is not possible in declarative files such as ``setup.cfg`` or
``pyproject.toml``, and furthermore ultimately extras names have to be converted
to strings in the package metadata. Having::

    Provides-Extra: None

would be indistinguishable from the string 'None' which may already be used as
an extras name in a Python package. If we were to modify the core metadata
syntax to allow non-string 'special' extras names, then we would be back to
modifying the core metadata specification, which is no better than
introducing ``Default-Extra``.

Relying on tooling to deselect any default extras
-------------------------------------------------

Another option to unselect extras would be to implement this at the
level of packaging tools. For instance, pip could include an option such as::

    pip install package --no-default-extras

This option could apply to all or specific packages, similar to
the ``--no-binary`` option, e.g.,::

    pip install package --no-default-extras :all:

The advantage of this approach is that tools supporting default extras could
also support unselecting them. This approach would be similar to the ``--no-install-recommends``
option for the ``apt`` tool.

However, this solution is not ideal because it would not allow packages to
specify themselves that they do not need some of the default extras of a
dependency. It would also carry risks for users who might disable all default
extras in a big dependency tree, potentially breaking packages in the tree that
rely on default extras at any point. Nevertheless, this PEP does not disallow
this approach and it is up to the maintainers of different packaging tools to
decide if they want to support this kind of option.

``package[]`` disables default extras
-------------------------------------

Another way to specify not to install any extras, including default extras, would
be to use ``package[]``. However, this would break the current assumption in packaging tools that
``package[]`` is equivalent to ``package``, and may also result
in developers overusing ``[]`` by default even when it is not needed. As
highlighted in `How to teach this`_, there may also be cases where package
maintainers do not actually want to support an installation without any extras,
for example in cases where at least one backend or frontend should be installed.
