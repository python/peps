Abstract
========

Software Bill-of-Materials (SBOM) are a technology-and-ecosystem-agnostic
method for describing software composition, provenance, licensing, and more.
SBOMs are used as inputs for software composition analysis (SCA) tools,
such as scanners for vulnerabilities and licenses, and have been gaining
traction in global software regulations and frameworks.

This PEP proposes using SBOM documents included in Python packages as a
means to improve software measurability for Python packages.

Motivation
==========

Measurability and Phantom Dependencies
--------------------------------------

Python packages are particularly affected by the "`phantom dependency`_" problem,
where software components that aren't written in Python are included in Python packages
for many reasons, such as ease of installation and compatibility with standards:

* Python serves scientific, data, web, and machine-learning use-cases which use compiled or non-Python languages like Rust, C, C++, Fortran, JavaScript, and others.
* The Python wheel format is preferred by users due to the ease-of-installation. No code is executed during the installation step, only extracting the archive.
* The Python wheel format requires bundling shared compiled libraries without a method to encode metadata about these libraries.
* Packages related to Python packaging sometimes need to solve the "bootstrapping" problem,
  so include pure Python projects inside their source code.

These software components can't be described using Python package metadata and thus
are likely to be missed by software composition analysis (SCA) software which can mean
vulnerable software components aren't reported accurately.

Regulations
-----------

SBOMs are required by recent software security regulations, like the `Secure Software Development Framework`_ (SSDF)
and the `Cyber Resilience Act`_ (CRA). Due to their inclusion in these regulations, the demand for SBOM documents of open source projects is expected to be high.
One goal is to minimize the demands on open source project maintainers by enabling
open source users that need SBOMs to self-serve using existing tooling.

Another goal is to enable contributions from users who need SBOMs to annotate projects they depend on with SBOM information.
Today there is no mechanism to propagate the results of those contributions for a Python package so there is no incentive
for users to contribute this type of work.

Rationale
=========

Using SBOM standards instead of core metadata fields
----------------------------------------------------

Attempting to add every field offered by SBOM standards into Python package core metadata
would result in an explosion of new core metadata fields, including the need to keep up-to-date as
SBOM standards continue to evolve to suit new needs in that space.

Instead, this proposal delegates SBOM-specific metadata to SBOM documents that are included in Python packages
and adds a new Python core metadata field for discoverability of included SBOM documents.

This standard also doesn't aim to replace Python core metadata with SBOMs, instead
focusing on the SBOM information being supplemental to core metadata.
Included SBOMs only contain information about dependencies included in the package archive
or information about the top-level software in the package that can't be encoded into core metadata
but is relevant for the SBOM use-case ("software identifiers", "purpose", "support level", etc).

Zero-or-more SBOM documents per package
---------------------------------------

Rather than requiring at most one included SBOM document per Python package, this PEP proposes
that one or more SBOM documents may be included in a Python package. This means that code
attempting to annotate a Python package with SBOM data may do so without being concerned
about corrupting data already contained within other SBOM documents. This decision
also means this PEP is capable of supporting multiple SBOM standards without favoring one,
instead deferring support to SBOM consuming tools.

Specification
=============

The changes necessary to implement this PEP include:

* Additions to :ref:`Core Metadata <9999-spec-core-metadata>`, as defined in the `specification <coremetadataspec>`_.
* Additions to the author-provided :ref:`project source metadata <9999-spec-source-metadata>`, as defined in the `specification <pyprojecttoml>`_.
* :ref:`Additions <9999-spec-project-formats>`_ to the source distribution (sdist), built distribution (wheel), and installed project specifications.

In addition to the above, an informational PEP will be created for tools
consuming included SBOM documents and other Python package metadata to
generate complete SBOM documents for Python packages.

Core Metadata
-------------

Add ``Sbom-File`` field
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``Sbom-File`` is an optional Core Metadata field. Each instance
contains a string representation of the path of an SBOM document.
The path is located within the project source tree, relative to the project
root directory. It is a multi-use field that MAY appear zero or more times
and each instance lists the path to one such file. Files specified under this field

As specified by this PEP, its value is also that file's path relative to the root
SBOM directory in both installed projects and the standardized Distribution Package types.

If a ``Sbom-File`` is listed in a Source Distribution or Built Distribution's Core metadata:

* That file MUST be included in the distribution archive at the specified path relative to the root license directory.
* That file MUST be installed with the project at that same relative path.
* Inside the root SBOM directory, packaging tools MUST reproduce the directory structure under which the source files are located relative to the project root.
* Path delimiters MUST be the forward slash character (``\/``), and parent directory indicators (``..``) MUST NOT be used.
* SBOM document contents MUST be UTF-8 encoded JSON according to :rfc:`8259`.
* SBOM document contents MUST use an SBOM standard, and for better interoperability
  SHOULD be a well-known SBOM standard such as CycloneDX or SPDX.
* The "primary" component being described in included SBOM documents MUST be the Python package.
  This is achieved in CycloneDX using the ``metadata.component`` field and in SPDX using the ``DESCRIBES``
  relationship.
* SBOM documents MUST include metadata for the timestamp when the SBOM document was created.
  This information helps consuming tools understand the order that multiple SBOM documents were created
  to untangle conflicts between various stages building the Python package.
* SBOM documents SHOULD include metadata describing the tool creating the SBOM document.
  This information helps users find which tool needs to be fixed in the case of defects.

For all newly-uploaded distribution archives that include one or more ``Sbom-File`` fields in their Core Metadata
and declare a ``Metadata-Version`` of ``2.5`` or higher, PyPI SHOULD validate that all specified files are present
in the distribution archives, are valid UTF-8 encoded JSON, and for well-known SBOM standards provide the minimum
required fields by those standards and this PEP.

Project source metadata
-----------------------

This PEP specifies changes to the project's source metadata under a ``[project]`` table in the ``pyproject.toml`` file.

Add ``sbom-files`` key
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A new ``sbom-files`` key is added to the ``[project]`` table for specifying paths in the project source tree
relative to ``pyproject.toml`` to file(s) containing SBOMs to be distributed with the package. This key corresponds
to the ``Sbom-File`` fields in the Core Metadata.

Its value is an array of strings which MUST contain valid glob patterns, as specified below:

* Alphanumeric characters, underscores (``_``), hyphens (``-``) and dots (``.``) MUST be matched verbatim.
* Special glob characters: ``*``, ``?``, ``**`` and character ranges: ``[]`` containing only the verbatim matched characters MUST be supported. Within ``[...]``, the hyphen indicates a locale-agnostic range (e.g. a-z, order based on Unicode code points). Hyphens at the start or end are matched literally.
* Path delimiters MUST be the forward slash character (``/``). Patterns are relative to the directory containing pyproject.toml, therefore the leading slash character MUST NOT be used.
* Parent directory indicators (``..``) MUST NOT be used.

Any characters or character sequences not covered by this specification are invalid. Projects MUST NOT use such values. Tools consuming this field SHOULD reject invalid values with an error.

Tools MUST assume that SBOM file content is valid UTF-8 encoded JSON, and SHOULD validate this an raise an error if it is not.

Literal paths (`e.g. ``bom.cdx.json``) are treated as valid globs which means they can also be defined.

Build tools:

* MUST treat each value as a glob pattern, and MUST raise an error if the pattern contains invalid glob syntax.
* MUST include all files matched by a listed pattern in all distribution archives.
* MUST list each matched file path under a ``Sbom-File`` field in the Core Metadata.
* MUST raise an error if any individual user-specified pattern does not match at least one file.

If the ``sbom-files`` key is present and is set to a value of an empty array, then tools MUST NOT include
any SBOM files and MUST NOT raise an error.

Examples of valid SBOM files declarations:

.. code-block:: toml

    [project]
    sbom-files = ["bom.json"]

    [project]
    sbom-files = ["sboms/openssl.cdx.json", "licenses/openssl.spdx.json"]

    [project]
    sbom-files = ["sboms/*"]

    [project]
    sbom-files = []

Examples of invalid SBOM files declarations:

.. code-block:: toml

    [project]
    sbom-files = ["..\bom.json"]

Reason: ``..`` must not be used. ``\\`` is an invalid path delimited, ``\/`` must be used.

.. code-block:: toml

    [project]
    sbom-files = ["bom{.json*"]

Reason: "bom{.json" is not a valid glob.

SBOM files in project formats
-----------------------------

A few additions will be made to the existing specifications.

:term:`Project source tree`\s
  Per :ref:`639-spec-source-metadata` section, the
  `Declaring Project Metadata specification <pyprojecttoml_>`__
  will be updated to reflect that SBOM file paths MUST be relative to the
  project root directory; i.e. the directory containing the ``pyproject.toml``
  (or equivalently, other legacy project configuration,
  e.g. ``setup.py``, ``setup.cfg``, etc).

:term:`Source distributions (sdists) <Source Distribution (or "sdist")>`

  The sdist specification will be updated to reflect that if the ``Metadata-Version`` is ``2.5`` or greater,
  the sdist MUST contain any SBOM files specified by the ``Sbom-File`` field in the ``PKG-INFO`` at their
  respective paths relative to the sdist (containing the ``pyproject.toml`` and the ``PKG-INFO`` Core Metadata).

:term:`Built distribution`\s (:term:`wheel`\s)

  The wheel specification will be updated to reflect that if the ``Metadata-Version`` is ``2.5`` or greater
  and one or more ``Sbom-File`` fields are specified, the ``.dist-info`` directory MUST contain a ``sboms``
  subdirectory, which MUST contain the files listed in the ``Sbom-File`` fields in the ``METADATA`` file at
  their respective paths relative to the ``sboms`` directory.

:term:`Installed project`\s

  The Recording Installed Projects specification will be updated to reflect that if the ``Metadata-Version`` is
  ``2.5`` or greater and one or more ``Sbom-File`` fields is specified, the ``.dist-info`` directory MUST contain
  a ``sboms`` subdirectory which MUST contain the files listed in the ``Sbom-File`` fields in the ``METADATA`` file
  at their respective paths relative to the ``sboms`` directory, and that any files in this directory MUST be
  copied from wheels by install tools.

Backwards Compatibility
=======================

There are no backwards compatibility concerns for this PEP.

The changes to Python package core metadata and ``pyproject.toml`` are
only additive, this PEP doesn't change the behavior of any existing fields.

Tools which are processing Python packages can use the ``Sbom-File`` core
metadata field to clearly delineate between packages which include SBOM
documents that implement this PEP (and thus have more requirements) and
packages which include SBOM documents before this PEP was authored.

Security Implications
=====================

Because SBOM documents can encode information about the original system
where a Python package is built (for example, the operating system name and
version, more rarely the names of paths) this information has the potential
to "leak" through the Python package to installers. If this information is sensitive,
then that could represent a security risk.

TODO(More security implications, phantom dependencies)

How to Teach This
=================

Most Python packages don't contain code from other software components and thus are already
measurable by SCA tools without the need of SBOM documents.

TODO(Add section on informational PEP for SBOM tools)

Reference Implementation
========================

[Link to any existing implementation and details about its state, e.g. proof-of-concept.]

TODO(Add reference impls)

Rejected Ideas
==============

Why not require a single SBOM standard?
---------------------------------------

Most discussion and development around SBOMs today focuses on two SBOM standards:
CycloneDX and SPDX. There is no clear "winner" between these two standards,
both standards are frequently used by projects and software ecosystems.

Because both standards are frequently used, tools for consuming and processing
SBOM documents commonly need to support both standards. This means that this PEP
is not constrained to select a single SBOM standard by its consumers and thus
can allow tools creating SBOM documents for inclusion in Python packages to
choose which SBOM standard works best for their use-case.

Open Issues
===========

Conditional project source SBOM files
-------------------------------------

How can a project specify an SBOM file that is conditional?
