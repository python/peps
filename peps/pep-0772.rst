========
Abstract
========

This PEP proposes a Python Packaging Council with broad authority over
packaging standards, tools, and implementations. Like the Python Steering
Council, the Packaging Council seeks to exercise this authority as rarely as
possible; instead, they use this power to establish standard processes.

Like :pep:`8016`, instead of trying to do everything in one PEP, this PEP
focuses on providing a minimal-but-solid foundation for further governance
decisions.

========================
Motivation and Rationale
========================

As Python packaging has matured, several interrelated problems with the current
way of managing the technical development, decision making and processes have
become apparent.

----
PyPA
----

The `Python Packaging Authority (PyPA)`_ was created to take over the
maintenance of `pip`_ and `virtualenv`_ from Ian Bicking, led by Brian Rosner,
Carl Meyer and Jannis Leidel. Over the years, additional projects got added to
the PyPA and the tooling maintained by the PyPA became the baseline tooling for
Python packaging, with additional package ecosystems using and building on top
of the tools and interoperability standards maintained by the PyPA.

:pep:`609` formalised PyPA's authority over the existing packaging tools, the
interoperability standards and their operation as a group of independent
projects under the same umbrella that aim to be interoperable. It also stated
that PyPA should be expected to provide opinions, insight and experience when
ecosystem-wide changes are being proposed. In particular, the work to support
existing projects and maintain a user guide has been excellent.

At the time of writing, PyPA does not have a community elected body and
individuals within the group meet ad hoc, rather than on a regular cadence. The
PyPA itself is defined by a group of projects rather than as a group of
individuals, with no direct oversight over its individuals.

------------
Packaging-WG
------------

The PSF's `Packaging Workgroup`_ was created to support the larger efforts of
improving and maintaining the packaging ecosystem in Python through fundraising
and disbursement of raised funds. It was expected to largely focus on efforts
such as Python Package Index (PyPI), pip, packaging.python.org, Setuptools, and
cross-project efforts.

The group made very good progress here in the past, but the scope and scale of
supporting Python's packaging ecosystem has grown considerably in the last few
years. There is both more work to be done and more stakeholders than ever
before. The Packaging Workgroup is also not a community elected body and does
not have a regular mechanism for changing, adding or removing members.

--------------------------
Interoperability Standards
--------------------------

The PyPA is responsible for creating and maintaining the interoperability
standards for Python packaging tools. The decision making for updating these
standards involves a standing delegation from the Python Steering Council to
specific individuals based on specific topics, and these individuals have the
ability to further delegate the decision making on the changes to other
individuals.

We know that this process is not sustainable and there has been a desire
expressed by many to have a designated body to make these decisions (including
the individuals with the standing delegations).

-----------------------
Python Steering Council
-----------------------

While there is overlap between the PyPA, Packaging-WG, and the Python core
team, the Steering Council is not well-placed to make decisions over Python
packaging matters directly. Packaging only tangentially intersects with Python
language evolution, packaging requires specialised expertise and deep domain
knowledge (much like typing or the C API), and there is a different cohort of
potential electors for a Packaging Council than the Steering Council.

------------
Expectations
------------

An elected Packaging Council would have authority over the interoperability
standards, would guide the packaging tooling provided with CPython, and have
the mandate to coordinate Python packaging efforts. This would provide a
better, more consistent experience to packagers, package consumers, tool
developers, PyPI, and other index maintainers. With greater transparency and
clearer goals via an elected Packaging Council, the PSF will also be able to
offer more tactical work, longer term strategic vision, and fundraising support
to all parts of this ecosystem.

Some expectations around the formation of a Packaging Council are that they
will facilitate:

* Work with PSF staff and the newly formed `User Success Workgroup`_ toward
  improving the user experience around packaging.
* A more stable packaging ecosystem that is more responsive to community input.
* Increased transparency and clearer shared goals for the packaging ecosystem.
* Increased tactical and fundraising support from the PSF, to increase capacity
  and funding available to packaging tools.

=============
Specification
=============

-----------------
Packaging Council
-----------------

The Packaging Council will be composed of five individuals.

Mandate
=======

The council shall work to:

* Maintain the quality and stability of the Python packaging standards.
* Formalise and maintain the relationship with the core team as well as the
  PSF.
* Establish appropriate decision-making processes.
* Improve Python packaging's user experience.
* Make contributing as accessible, inclusive, and sustainable as possible.
* Strive to seek consensus among contributors before acting in a formal capacity.

Responsibilities
================

The council shall:

* Have broad authority over the Python packaging standards and Python Packaging
  User Guide, that are maintained on https://packaging.python.org.
* Establish processes for making binding decisions regarding packaging
  standards, tools and implementations as well as for considering
  ecosystem-wide changes.
* Look for ways to use their direct authority as little as possible - seeking
  consensus and consent over voting.

To use its powers, the council votes. Every council member must either vote or
explicitly abstain. Members with conflicts of interest on a particular vote
must abstain. Passing requires support from a majority of non-abstaining
council members.

Whenever possible, the council is expected to share its decisions and processes
publicly in a timely fashion.

Delegations
-----------

The Python Steering Council is expected to delegate decision making to
the Packaging Council for PEPs related to the Python packaging.  The bodies
would work together on issues that intersect the packaging domain and language
stewardship (including the CPython implementation, standard library, and
distribution).

The PSF Board is encouraged to formally deprecate the Packaging Workgroup
and the Packaging Council would take on the responsibilities of the
PSF's Packaging Workgroup.

The PyPA is expected to work with the Packaging Council to establish a
decision making process that governs the technical projects under the PyPA
umbrella.

Processes
=========

Election of the council
-----------------------

A council election consists of two phases:

* Phase 1: A member of the Packaging community (defined later in this document)
  can self-nominate themselves for the council elections.
* Phase 2: Each Packaging community member can assign zero to five stars to
  each candidate. Voting is performed anonymously. The outcome of the vote is
  determined using the `STAR voting system`_, modified to use the `Multi-winner
  Bloc STAR`_ approach. If a tie occurs, it may be resolved by mutual agreement
  among the candidates, or else the winner will be chosen at random.

Each phase should last two weeks.

The election process is managed by one Returning Officer nominated by the
outgoing Packaging Council. For the initial election, the Returning Officer
will be nominated by the PSF Executive Director.

The PSF shall maintain records of the elections as well as run the annual
election for the council.

Term
----

There shall be two cohorts of council members: Cohort A composed of two
members and Cohort B composed of three members.

Each council member shall be elected for a two-year term, unless they are
replacing a council member that resigned, was removed, or otherwise becomes
vacant, in which case such replacement members shall be elected to a term
sufficient to complete a two-year term as measured from the term of the
original cohort.

Each council member's term will be two years, from when their elections are
finalised until the next elections for their cohort are finalised.

Only for elections involving the entire council (like the initial council
election), the two candidates receiving the highest number of votes shall be
designated Cohort A with a two year term, and the three candidates
receiving the highest number of votes after shall be designated Cohort B with a
one year term.

There are no term limits for individual council members.

Vacancies
---------

Council members may resign their position at any time.

Whenever there is a vacancy during the regular council term, the council may
vote to appoint a replacement to serve out the rest of the term.

If a council member drops out of touch and cannot be contacted for a month or
longer, then the rest of the council may vote to replace them (with a simple
majority vote, where the missing member is recorded as an abstention).

Conflicts of interest
---------------------

No more than two Packaging Council members should be employed by or
significantly affiliated with the same entity. An entity would be a company,
a company and its subsidiaries, or another incorporated entity such as a
non-profit or educational institution with its own mission and goals.  PSF members are explicitly exempt from this restriction, but _not_ PSF employees, directors, or officers.

While we trust council members to act in the best interests of Python rather
than themselves or their employers, the mere appearance of any one company
dominating Python development could itself be harmful and erode trust.

In a council election, if more than two of the top five vote-getters work for
the same employer, then whichever of them ranked lowest is disqualified and the
6th-ranking candidate moves up into 5th place; this is repeated until a valid
council is formed.

During a council term, if changing circumstances cause this rule to be broken
(for instance, due to a council member changing employment), then one or more
council members must resign to remedy the issue, and the resulting vacancies
can then be filled as normal.

-------------------
Packaging community
-------------------

Responsibility
==============

Packaging community members participate in formal votes to elect the Packaging
Council.

Processes
=========

Initial membership
------------------

Initial membership in the Packaging community will include anyone who has taken
the time to formalise their participation in the Packaging community. This
includes:

* PyPA members: Anyone with the triage bit or commit bit, or at least one
  project in the PyPA organisation.
* Packaging workgroup members: Anyone who is listed on the Packaging WG charter
  will be moved into the Packaging community.
* Interested core team members: Any Python core team member who is willing to
  participate is welcome.
* Wider community members: Non-profit organisations that participate in
  packaging or working with new packagers. For example, PyOpenSci, NumFocus,
  Django, are encouraged to initially nominate up to seven members by sending
  an email to \[todo\].

Adding a new member
-------------------

Members are added to the Packaging community by a simple majority vote by the
current membership. Quorum for adding new members is 50%.

A vote to add a new member is triggered when a Packaging community member calls
for one publicly on an appropriate communication channel, and another Packaging
community member seconds the call within two weeks.

The vote lasts for two weeks. Packaging community members vote for or against.

Removal of a member
-------------------

In order to maintain a reasonable expectation of quorum, failure to participate
in Packaging Council elections for two consecutive council elections
automatically removes a person from the list of voting members, until they
re-submit their intention to resume their participation to the Packaging
Council in writing.

In exceptional circumstances, it may be necessary to remove someone from the
Packaging community against their will (for example: egregious and ongoing code
of conduct violations). A Packaging community member may be removed by a
two-thirds majority vote by the Packaging Council (in practice: 4:1 for a
council with five members).

If the relevant Packaging community member is also on the Packaging Council,
then they can participate in the vote. They are removed from the Packaging
Council if the vote removes them from the Packaging community. The vacancy is
filled as per the process for filling vacancies in the Packaging Council.

Vote of no confidence
---------------------

In exceptional circumstances, the Packaging community may remove a sitting
council member, or the entire council, via a vote of no confidence.

A no-confidence vote is triggered when a Packaging community member calls for
one publicly on an appropriate public communication channel, and another
Packaging community member seconds the call within two weeks.

The vote lasts for two weeks. Packaging community members vote for or against.
If at least two thirds of voters express a lack of confidence, then the vote
succeeds. Quorum for a vote of no confidence is 50%.

There are two forms of no-confidence votes: those targeting a single member,
and those targeting the council as a whole. The initial call for a
no-confidence vote must specify which type is intended. If a single-member vote
succeeds, then that member is removed from the council and the resulting
vacancy can be handled in the usual way. If a whole-council vote succeeds, the
council is dissolved and a new council election is triggered immediately.

-----------------------
Changing the governance
-----------------------

Changes to this governance model, once it is accepted, will require at least a
two-thirds majority of votes cast in a Packaging community vote which should be
open for two weeks.

==============
Rejected Ideas
==============

----------------------------------------
Annual elections for all council members
----------------------------------------

An annual term for council members is the approach taken for the Python
Steering Council's elections. This PEP uses a cohort-based model, derived from
the PSF Board's elections which enables continuity of members across a changing
council.

There is a trade-off between continuity of the council and reshuffles. This PEP
takes the position that continuity will be more valuable for the Python
Packaging space, especially combined with the vote of no confidence, automatic
removal of inactive voters and regular elections.

-------------------------------
Term limits for council members
-------------------------------

While this is viewed as valuable for boards in general, this was rejected
because of the size of the pool of interested and qualified people who might
serve.

-------------------------------
Approval voting in the election
-------------------------------

An earlier non-public draft of this PEP used an approval voting process, which
aligned with what :pep:`13` stated at the time of writing. The Python core team
has changed their governance to use Bloc STAR and this PEP was updated to align
with that for the same reasons as the core team's move to Bloc STAR: it better
captures voter intention in the results.

------------------------------------------------------------------
Disallow multiple people from the same organisation on the council
------------------------------------------------------------------

This PEP currently mirrors the Python Steering Council's limit, that at most
two individuals related to a single organisation can be on the council.

Limiting it to one is workable; although it hasn't come up in the SC, people do
move around, and we wouldn't want good candidates to either make employment
decisions based on PC membership, or have to resign based on an employment
change.  Limiting it to a maximum of two, plus votes of no confidence is
probably sufficient safety from any undue employer influence.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Establishing specific processes for Packaging Council and PyPA relationship
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

As noted in the abstract, the focus of this PEP is on providing a
minimal-but-solid foundation for further governance decisions. The specifics of
this relationship would be figured out by the inaugural council.

=======================================
Appendix: Approval process for this PEP
=======================================

This PEP would likely require an atypical process for approval given that it
requires changes to PyPA's governance (which involves a PyPA-committers vote)
and it requires the Python Steering Council to change their delegations.

To that end, the process for approval for this PEP will be:

* Submit this PEP for a vote on the pypa-committers mailing list, in accordance
  with the process outlined in :pep:`609`.
* Submit this PEP for the Python Steering Council's comments and approval.
* Reconcile any outstanding variances in text and repeat, if necessary.

=================================================
Appendix: Operational suggestions for the council
=================================================

This section is based on what the PEP's authors view as things that would be
beneficial for the Packaging Council to establish operational processes for.
These are non-binding yet strongly encouraged.

The PSF will designate a staff person to be the Packaging Council's official
liaison who will regularly attend meetings, since it is expected that the
Packaging Council will meet on a regular basis (twice a month).

* Coordinate with the Steering Council on PEPs that need input from both
  groups.
* Coordinate with PyPA on their ongoing work to support individual projects.
* Delegate to domain experts or working groups in the Packaging community, for
  initiatives/PEPs with a niche focus (analogous to how the Steering Council
  sends certain PEPs to the C API working group).
* Scope out work that might best be done by hiring someone and then work with
  PSF to establish outcomes and a reasonable budget.
* The Packaging Council (similar to the Steering Council) is encouraged to
  communicate with and when necessary seek advice from the PSF's Conduct
  Working Group.
* Regularly synchronize with the Steering Council on a mutually agreed cadence,
  with a recommended frequency of no less than once per quarter.
* Publish public agendas and minutes in a timely fashion.
* Provide casual real-time opportunities for people to bring topics that are
  not PEPs, like office hours, a forum channel, or panels at Python events.
