PEP: 222
Title: Web Library Enhancements

Abstract
========

This PEP proposes a set of enhancements to the CGI development
facilities in the Python standard library.  Enhancements might be
new features, new modules for tasks such as cookie support, or
removal of obsolete code.

The original intent was to make improvements to Python 2.1.
However, there seemed little interest from the Python community,
and time was lacking, so this PEP has been deferred to some future
Python release.


Open Issues
===========

This section lists changes that have been suggested, but about
which no firm decision has yet been made.  In the final version of
this PEP, this section should be empty, as all the changes should
be classified as accepted or rejected.

cgi.py: We should not be told to create our own subclass just so
we can handle file uploads. As a practical matter, I have yet to
find the time to do this right, so I end up reading cgi.py's temp
file into, at best, another file. Some of our legacy code actually
reads it into a second temp file, then into a final destination!
And even if we did, that would mean creating yet another object
with its ``__init__`` call and associated overhead.

cgi.py: Currently, query data with no ``=`` are ignored.  Even if
``keep_blank_values`` is set, queries like ``...?value=&...`` are
returned with blank values but queries like ``...?value&...`` are
completely lost.  It would be great if such data were made
available through the ``FieldStorage`` interface, either as entries
with ``None`` as values, or in a separate list.

Utility function: build a query string from a list of 2-tuples

Dictionary-related utility classes: ``NoKeyErrors`` (returns an empty
string, never a ``KeyError``), ``PartialStringSubstitution`` (returns
the original key string, never a ``KeyError``)



New Modules
===========

This section lists details about entire new packages or modules
that should be added to the Python standard library.

* fcgi.py : A new module adding support for the FastCGI protocol.
  Robin Dunn's code needs to be ported to Windows, though.


Major Changes to Existing Modules
=================================

This section lists details of major changes to existing modules,
whether in implementation or in interface.  The changes in this
section therefore carry greater degrees of risk, either in
introducing bugs or a backward incompatibility.

The cgi.py module would be deprecated.  (XXX A new module or
package name hasn't been chosen yet: 'web'?  'cgilib'?)


Minor Changes to Existing Modules
=================================

This section lists details of minor changes to existing modules.
These changes should have relatively small implementations, and
have little risk of introducing incompatibilities with previous
versions.


Rejected Changes
================

The changes listed in this section were proposed for Python 2.1,
but were rejected as unsuitable.  For each rejected change, a
rationale is given describing why the change was deemed
inappropriate.

* An HTML generation module is not part of this PEP.  Several such
  modules exist, ranging from HTMLgen's purely programming
  interface to ASP-inspired simple templating to DTML's complex
  templating.  There's no indication of which templating module to
  enshrine in the standard library, and that probably means that
  no module should be so chosen.

* cgi.py: Allowing a combination of query data and POST data.
  This doesn't seem to be standard at all, and therefore is
  dubious practice.


Proposed Interface
==================

XXX open issues: naming convention (studlycaps or
underline-separated?); need to look at the ``cgi.parse*()`` functions
and see if they can be simplified, too.

Parsing functions: carry over most of the ``parse*`` functions from
cgi.py
