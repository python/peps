PEP: 373
Title: Python 2.7 Release Schedule
Author: Benjamin Peterson <benjamin@python.org>
Status: Final
Type: Informational
Topic: Release
Created: 03-Nov-2008
Python-Version: 2.7


Abstract
========

This document describes the development and release schedule for
Python 2.7.

Python 2.7 is the end of the Python 2.x series, and is succeeded by
Python 3. See `the "Sunsetting Python 2" FAQ on python.org
<https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/>`_ for a general
overview.


Update (April 2014)
===================

The End Of Life date (EOL, sunset date) for Python 2.7 has been moved
five years into the future, to 2020.  This decision was made to
clarify the status of Python 2.7 and relieve worries for those users
who cannot yet migrate to Python 3.  See also :pep:`466`.

This declaration does not guarantee that bugfix releases will be made
on a regular basis, but it should enable volunteers who want to
contribute bugfixes for Python 2.7 and it should satisfy vendors who
still have to support Python 2 for years to come.

There will be no Python 2.8 (see :pep:`404`).
