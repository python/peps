Abstract
========

This document describes the schedule and other details of the January
2019 election for the Python steering council, as specified in
:pep:`13`. This is the first steering council election.


Returns officer
===============

In future elections, the returns officer will be appointed by the
outgoing steering council. Since this is the first election, we have
no outgoing steering council, and :pep:`13` says that the returns officer
is instead appointed by the PSF Executive Director, Ewa Jodlowska.
`She appointed Ee Durbin
