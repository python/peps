Abstract
========

In Python, threads are able to interact with an interpreter (e.g., invoke the
bytecode loop) through an :term:`attached thread state`. On with-GIL builds,
only one thread can hold an attached thread state at once, which means that
the thread holds the :term:`GIL`. On free-threaded builds, there can be
an unbounded number of thread states attached, allowing for parallelism (because
multiple threads can invoke the interpreter at once).

With that in mind, attachment of thread states is a bit problematic in the C API.
The C API currently provides two ways to acquire and attach a thread state for
an interpreter:

- :c:func:`PyGILState_Ensure` & :c:func:`PyGILState_Release`.
- :c:func:`PyThreadState_New` & :c:func:`PyThreadState_Swap` (significantly
  less common).

The former, :c:func:`PyGILState_Ensure` and :c:func:`PyGILState_Release`,
are the most common way to do this and have been the standard for over twenty
years (:pep:`311`), but have a number of issues that have arisen over time:

- Subinterpreters tend to have trouble with them, because in threads that
  haven't ever had an attached thread state, :c:func:`PyGILState_Ensure`
  will assume that the main interpreter was requested. This makes it
  impossible for the thread to interact with the subinterpreter!
- The phrase "GIL" is confusing for developers of free-threaded
  extensions, because there's no GIL there, right? Even on free-threaded
  builds, threads still needs a thread state to interact with the interpreter,
  it's just that they don't have to wait on one-another to do so. These days,
  the important thing that :c:func:`PyGILState_Ensure` does is get attach a
  thread state, and acquiring the GIL is somewhat incidental.

The other option, :c:func:`PyThreadState_New` and :c:func:`PyThreadState_Swap`,
do solve those issues, but come with an additional problem with how thread state
attachment works in the C API (that ``PyGILState`` also includes): if the
thread is not the main thread, then the interpreter will randomly hang the
thread during attachment if it starts finalizing. This is a problem for large
applications that want to use their thread in addition to calling Python.

This PEP intends to solve these issues by providing :c:func:`PyThreadState_Ensure`
and :c:func:`PyThreadState_Release` as replacements for the existing functions,
accompanied by some interpreter reference counting APIs that let thread states
be acquired and attached in a thread-safe and predictable manner.

Terminology
===========

Interpreters
------------

In this proposal, "interpreter" refers to a singular, isolated interpreter
(see :pep:`684`), with its own :c:type:`PyInterpreterState` pointer (referred
to as an "interpreter-state"). "Interpreter" *does not* refer to the entirety
of a Python process.

The "current interpreter" refers to the interpreter-state
pointer on an :term:`attached thread state`, as returned by
:c:func:`PyThreadState_GetInterpreter`.

Native and Python Threads
-------------------------

This PEP refers to a thread created using the C API as a "native thread",
also sometimes referred to as a "non-Python created thread", where a "Python
created" is a thread created by the :mod:`threading` module.

Native threads are typically created by :c:func:`PyGILState_Ensure`, but more
technically, it refers to any thread with an :term:`attached thread state`
created and/or attached using the C API.

Motivation
==========

Native Threads Always Hang During Finalization
----------------------------------------------

Many large libraries might need to call Python code in highly-asynchronous
situations where the desired interpreter
(:ref:`typically the main interpreter <pep-788-subinterpreters-gilstate>`)
could be finalizing or deleted, but want to continue running code after
invoking the interpreter. This desire has been
`brought up by users <https://discuss.python.org/t/78850/>`_.
For example, a callback that wants to call Python code might be invoked when:

- A kernel has finished running on a GPU.
- A network packet was received.
- A thread has quit, and a native library is executing static finalizers of
  thread local storage.

Generally, this pattern would look something like this:

.. code-block:: c

    static void
    some_callback(void *closure)
    {
        /* Do some work */
        /* ... */

        PyGILState_STATE gstate = PyGILState_Ensure();
        /* Invoke the C API to do some computation */
        PyGILState_Release(gstate);

        /* ... */
    }

In the current C API, any "native" thread (one not created via the
:mod:`threading` module) is considered to be "daemon", meaning that the interpreter
won't wait on that thread before shutting down. Instead, the interpreter will hang the
thread when it goes to :term:`attach <attached thread state>` a :term:`thread state`,
making the thread unusable past that point. Attaching a thread state can happen at
any point when invoking Python, such as in-between bytecode instructions
(to yield the :term:`GIL` to a different thread), or when a C function exits a
:c:macro:`Py_BEGIN_ALLOW_THREADS` block, so simply guarding against whether the
interpreter is finalizing isn't enough to safely call Python code. (Note that hanging
the thread is relatively new behavior; in prior versions, the thread would terminate,
but the issue is the same.)

This means that any non-Python/native thread may be terminated at any point, which
is severely limiting for users who want to do more than just execute Python
code in their stream of calls.

Joining the Thread isn't Always Possible
****************************************

In general, it's possible to prevent hanging of threads created while Python
is active through :mod:`atexit` functions. A thread could be started by some
C function, and then as long as that thread is joined by :mod:`atexit`, then
the thread won't hang. Reasonable enough, right?

Unfortunately, :mod:`atexit` isn't always an option, because to call it, you
need to already have an :term:`attached thread state` for the thread. If
there's no guarantee of that, then :func:`atexit.register` cannot be safely
called without the risk of hanging the thread.

For example, large C++ applications might want to expose an interface that can
call Python code. To do this, a function would take a Python object, and then
call :c:func:`PyGILState_Ensure` to safely interact with it (e.g., by calling
it). If the interpreter is finalizing or has shut down, then the thread is
hung, disrupting the C++ caller.

``Py_IsFinalizing`` is Insufficient
***********************************

The :ref:`docs <python:gilstate>`
currently recommend :c:func:`Py_IsFinalizing` to guard against termination of
the thread:

    Calling this function from a thread when the runtime is finalizing will
    terminate the thread, even if the thread was not created by Python. You
    can use ``Py_IsFinalizing()`` or ``sys.is_finalizing()`` to check if the
    interpreter is in process of being finalized before calling this function
    to avoid unwanted termination.

Unfortunately, this isn't correct, because of time-of-call to time-of-use
issues; the interpreter might not be finalizing during the call to
:c:func:`Py_IsFinalizing`, but it might start finalizing immediately
afterwards, which would cause the attachment of a thread state to hang the
thread.

Daemon Threads Can Break Finalization
*************************************

When acquiring locks, it's extremely important to detach the thread state to
prevent deadlocks. This is true on both the with-GIL and free-threaded builds.

When the GIL is enabled, a deadlock can occur pretty easily when acquiring a
lock if the GIL wasn't released; thread A grabs a lock, and starts waiting on
its thread state to attach, while thread B holds the GIL and is waiting on the
lock. A similar deadlock can occur on the free-threaded build during stop-the-world
pauses when running the garbage collector.

This affects CPython itself, and there's not much that can be done
to fix it with the current API. For example,
`python/cpython#129536 <https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/129536>`_
remarks that the :mod:`ssl` module can emit a fatal error when used at
finalization, because a daemon thread got hung while holding the lock.

.. _pep-788-hanging-compat:

Finalization Behavior for ``PyGILState_Ensure`` Cannot Change
*************************************************************

There will always have to be a point in a Python program where
:c:func:`PyGILState_Ensure` can no longer attach a thread state.
If the interpreter is long dead, then Python obviously can't give a
thread a way to invoke it. :c:func:`PyGILState_Ensure` doesn't have any
meaningful way to return a failure, so it has no choice but to terminate
the thread or emit a fatal error, as noted in
`python/cpython#124622 <https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/124622>`_:

    I think a new GIL acquisition and release C API would be needed. The way
    the existing ones get used in existing C code is not amenible to suddenly
    bolting an error state onto; none of the existing C code is written that
    way. After the call they always just assume they have the GIL and can
    proceed. The API was designed as "it'll block and only return once it has
    the GIL" without any other option.

For this reason, we can't make any real changes to how :c:func:`PyGILState_Ensure`
works during finalization, because it would break existing code.

The GIL-state APIs are Buggy and Confusing
------------------------------------------

There are currently two public ways for a user to create and attach a
:term:`thread state` for their thread; manual use of :c:func:`PyThreadState_New`
and :c:func:`PyThreadState_Swap`, and :c:func:`PyGILState_Ensure`. The latter,
:c:func:`PyGILState_Ensure`, is `the most common <https://grep.app/search?q=pygilstate_ensure>`_.

``PyGILState_Ensure`` Generally Crashes During Finalization
***********************************************************

At the time of writing, the current behavior of :c:func:`PyGILState_Ensure` does not
always match the documentation. Instead of hanging the thread during finalization
as previously noted, it's possible for it to crash with a segmentation
fault. This is a `known issue <https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/124619>`_
that could be fixed in CPython, but it's definitely worth noting
here. Incidentally, acceptance and implementation of this PEP will likely fix
the existing crashes caused by :c:func:`PyGILState_Ensure`.

The Term "GIL" is Tricky for Free-threading
*******************************************

A large issue with the term "GIL" in the C API is that it is semantically
misleading. This was noted in `python/cpython#127989
<https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/127989>`_,
created by the authors of this PEP:

    The biggest issue is that for free-threading, there is no GIL, so users
    erroneously call the C API inside ``Py_BEGIN_ALLOW_THREADS`` blocks or
    omit ``PyGILState_Ensure`` in fresh threads.

Again, :c:func:`PyGILState_Ensure` gets an :term:`attached thread state`
for the thread on both with-GIL and free-threaded builds. To demonstate,
:c:func:`PyGILState_Ensure` is very roughly equivalent to the following:

.. code-block:: c

    PyGILState_STATE
    PyGILState_Ensure(void)
    {
        PyThreadState *existing = PyThreadState_GetUnchecked();
        if (existing == NULL) {
            // Chooses the interpreter of the last attached thread state
            // for this thread. If Python has never ran in this thread, the
            // main interpreter is used.
            PyInterpreterState *interp = guess_interpreter();
            PyThreadState *tstate = PyThreadState_New(interp);
            PyThreadState_Swap(tstate);
            return opaque_tstate_handle(tstate);
        } else {
            return opaque_tstate_handle(existing);
        }
    }

An attached thread state is always needed to call the C API, so
:c:func:`PyGILState_Ensure` still needs to be called on free-threaded builds,
but with a name like "ensure GIL", it's not immediately clear that that's true.

.. _pep-788-subinterpreters-gilstate:

``PyGILState_Ensure`` Doesn't Guess the Correct Interpreter
-----------------------------------------------------------

As noted in the :ref:`documentation <python:gilstate>`,
the ``PyGILState`` functions aren't officially supported in subinterpreters:

    Note that the ``PyGILState_*`` functions assume there is only one global
    interpreter (created automatically by ``Py_Initialize()``). Python
    supports the creation of additional interpreters (using
    ``Py_NewInterpreter()``), but mixing multiple interpreters and the
    ``PyGILState_*`` API is unsupported.

This is because :c:func:`PyGILState_Ensure` doesn't have any way
to know which interpreter created the thread, and as such, it has to assume
that it was the main interpreter. There isn't any way to detect this at
runtime, so spurious races are bound to come up in threads created by
subinterpreters, because synchronization for the wrong interpreter will be
used on objects shared between the threads.

For example, if the thread had access to object A, which belongs to a
subinterpreter, but then called :c:func:`PyGILState_Ensure`, the thread would
have an :term:`attached thread state` pointing to the main interpreter,
not the subinterpreter. This means that any :term:`GIL` assumptions about the
object are wrong! There isn't any synchronization between the two GILs, so both
the thread (who thinks it's in the subinterpreter) and the main thread could try
to increment the reference count at the same time, causing a data race!

Concurrent Interpreter Deallocation is Frustrating
--------------------------------------------------

The other way of creating a native thread that can invoke Python,
:c:func:`PyThreadState_New` and :c:func:`PyThreadState_Swap`, is a lot better
for supporting subinterpreters (because :c:func:`PyThreadState_New` takes an
explicit interpreter, rather than assuming that the main interpreter was
requested), but is still limited by the current hanging problems in the C API.

In addition, subinterpreters typically have a much shorter lifetime than the
main interpreter, so there's a much higher chance that an interpreter passed
to a thread will have already finished and have been deallocated. So, passing
that interpreter to :c:func:`PyThreadState_New` will most likely crash the program
because of a use-after-free on the interpreter-state.

Rationale
=========

So, how do we address all of this? The best way seems to be starting from
scratch and "reimagining" how to create, acquire and attach
:term:`thread states <thread state>` in the C API.

Preventing Interpreter Shutdown with Reference Counting
-------------------------------------------------------

This PEP takes an approach where an interpreter is given a reference count
that prevents it from shutting down.

So, holding a "strong reference" to the interpreter will make it safe to
call the C API without worrying about the thread being hung.

This means that interfacing Python (for example, in a C++ library) will need
a reference to the interpreter in order to safely call the object, which is
definitely more inconvenient than assuming the main interpreter is the right
choice, but there's not really another option.

Weak References
***************

This proposal also comes with weak references to an interpreter that don't
prevent it from shutting down, but can be promoted to a strong reference when
the user decides that they want to call the C API. Promotion of a weak reference
to a strong reference can fail if the interpreter has already finalized, or
reached a point during finalization where it can't be guaranteed that the
thread won't hang.

Deprecation of the GIL-state APIs
---------------------------------

Due to the plethora of issues with ``PyGILState``, this PEP intends to do away
with them entirely. In today's C API, all ``PyGILState`` functions are
replaceable with ``PyThreadState`` counterparts that are compatibile with
subinterpreters:

- :c:func:`PyGILState_Ensure`: :c:func:`PyThreadState_Swap` & :c:func:`PyThreadState_New`
- :c:func:`PyGILState_Release`: :c:func:`PyThreadState_Clear` & :c:func:`PyThreadState_Delete`
- :c:func:`PyGILState_GetThisThreadState`: :c:func:`PyThreadState_Get`
- :c:func:`PyGILState_Check`: ``PyThreadState_GetUnchecked() != NULL``

This PEP specifies a ten-year deprecation for these functions (while remaining
in the stable ABI), mainly because it's expected that the migration will be a
little painful, because :c:func:`PyThreadState_Ensure` and
:c:func:`PyThreadState_Release` aren't drop-in replacements for
:c:func:`PyGILState_Ensure` and :c:func:`PyGILState_Release`, due to the
requirement of a specific interpreter. The exact details of this deprecation
aren't too clear, see :ref:`pep-788-deprecation`.

Specification
=============

Interpreter References to Prevent Shutdown
------------------------------------------

An interpreter will keep a reference count that's managed by users of the
C API. When the interpreter starts finalizing, it will until its reference count
reaches zero before proceeding to a point where threads will be hung.
Note that this *is not* the same as joining the thread; the interpreter will
only wait until the reference count is zero, and then proceed. The interpreter
must not hang threads until this reference count has reached zero.
After the reference count has reached zero, threads can no longer prevent the
interpreter from shutting down.

A weak reference to the interpreter won't prevent it from finalizing, but can
be safely accessed after the interpreter no longer supports strong references,
and even after the interpreter has been deleted. But, at that point, the weak
reference can no longer be promoted to a strong reference.

Strong Interpreter References
*****************************

.. c:type:: PyInterpreterRef

   An opaque, strong reference to an interpreter.
   The interpreter will wait until a strong reference has been released
   before shutting down.

   This type is guaranteed to be pointer-sized.

.. c:function:: PyInterpreterRef PyInterpreterRef_Get(void)

    Acquire a strong reference to the current interpreter.

    This function cannot fail, other than with a fatal error when the caller
    doesn't hold an :term:`attached thread state`.

.. c:function:: int PyInterpreterState_AsStrong(PyInterpreterState *interp, PyInterpreterRef *ref_ptr)

    Acquire a strong reference to *interp*.

    Unless *interp* is the main interpreter, this function can cause crashes
    if *interp* shuts down in another thread! Prefer safely acquiring a
    reference through :c:func:`PyInterpreterRef_Get` whenever possible.

    On success, this function will return ``0`` and set *ref_ptr* to a strong
    reference, and on failure, this function will return ``-1``.
    (Failure typically indicates that *interp* has already finished
    waiting on its reference count.)

    The caller does not need to hold an :term:`attached thread state`.

.. c:function:: PyInterpreterState *PyInterpreterRef_AsInterpreter(PyInterpreterRef ref)

    Return the interpreter denoted by *ref*.

    This function cannot fail, and the caller doesn't need to hold an
    :term:`attached thread state`.

.. c:function:: PyInterpreterRef PyInterpreterRef_Dup(PyInterpreterRef ref)

    Duplicate a strong reference to an interpreter.

    This function cannot fail, and the caller doesn't need to hold an
    :term:`attached thread state`.

.. c:function:: void PyInterpreterRef_Close(PyInterpreterRef ref)

    Release a strong reference to an interpreter, allowing it to shut down
    if there are no references left.

    This function cannot fail, and the caller doesn't need to hold an
    :term:`attached thread state`.

Weak Interpreter References
***************************

.. c:type:: PyInterpreterWeakRef

    An opaque, weak reference to an interpreter.
    The interpreter will *not* wait for the reference to be
    released before shutting down.

.. c:function:: PyInterpreterWeakRef PyInterpreterWeakRef_Get(void)

    Acquire a weak reference to the current interpreter.

    This function is generally meant to be used in tandem with
    :c:func:`PyInterpreterWeakRef_AsStrong`, and cannot fail.

    The caller must hold an :term:`attached thread state`.

.. c:function:: PyInterpreterWeakRef PyInterpreterWeakRef_Dup(PyInterpreterWeakRef wref)

    Duplicate a weak reference to *wref*.

    This function is generally meant to be used in tandem with
    :c:func:`PyInterpreterWeakRef_AsStrong`.

    This function cannot fail, and the caller doesn't need to hold an
    :term:`attached thread state`.

.. c:function:: int PyInterpreterWeakRef_AsStrong(PyInterpreterWeakRef wref, PyInterpreterRef *ref_ptr)

    Acquire a strong reference to an interpreter through a weak reference.

    On success, this function returns ``0`` and sets *ref_ptr* to a strong
    reference to the interpreter denoted by *wref*.

    If the interpreter no longer exists or has already finished waiting
    for its reference count to reach zero, then this function returns ``-1``.

    This function is not safe to call in a re-entrant signal handler.

    The caller does not need to hold an :term:`attached thread state`.

.. c:function:: void PyInterpreterWeakRef_Close(PyInterpreterWeakRef wref)

    Release a weak reference, possibly deallocating it.

    This function cannot fail, and the caller doesn't need to hold an
    :term:`attached thread state`.

Ensuring and Releasing Thread States
------------------------------------

This proposal includes two new high-level threading APIs that intend to
replace :c:func:`PyGILState_Ensure` and :c:func:`PyGILState_Release`.

.. c:function:: int PyThreadState_Ensure(PyInterpreterRef ref)

    Ensure that the thread has an :term:`attached thread state` for the
    interpreter denoted by *ref*, and thus can safely invoke that
    interpreter. It is OK to call this function if the thread already has an
    attached thread state, as long as there is a subsequent call to
    :c:func:`PyThreadState_Release` that matches this one.

    Nested calls to this function will only sometimes create a new
    :term:`thread state`. If there is no attached thread state,
    then this function will check for the most recent attached thread
    state used by this thread. If none exists or it doesn't match *ref*,
    a new thread state is created. If it does match *ref*, it is reattached.
    If there is an attached thread state, then a similar check occurs;
    if the interpreter matches *ref*, it is attached, and otherwise a new
    thread state is created.

    Return zero on success, and non-zero with the old attached thread state
    restored (which may have been ``NULL``).

.. c:function:: void PyThreadState_Release()

    Release a :c:func:`PyThreadState_Ensure` call.

    The :term:`attached thread state` prior to the corresponding
    :c:func:`PyThreadState_Ensure` call is guaranteed to be restored upon
    returning. The cached thread state as used by :c:func:`PyThreadState_Ensure`
    and :c:func:`PyGILState_Ensure` will also be restored.

    This function cannot fail.

Deprecation of GIL-state APIs
-----------------------------

This PEP deprecates all of the existing ``PyGILState`` APIs in favor of the
existing and new ``PyThreadState`` APIs. Namely:

- :c:func:`PyGILState_Ensure`: use :c:func:`PyThreadState_Ensure` instead.
- :c:func:`PyGILState_Release`: use :c:func:`PyThreadState_Release` instead.
- :c:func:`PyGILState_GetThisThreadState`: use :c:func:`PyThreadState_Get` or
  :c:func:`PyThreadState_GetUnchecked` instead.
- :c:func:`PyGILState_Check`: use ``PyThreadState_GetUnchecked() != NULL``
  instead.

All of the ``PyGILState`` APIs are to be removed from the non-limited C API in
Python 3.25. They will remain available in the stable ABI for compatibility.

Backwards Compatibility
=======================

This PEP specifies a breaking change with the removal of all the
``PyGILState`` APIs from the public headers of the non-limited C API in 10
years (Python 3.25).

Security Implications
=====================

This PEP has no known security implications.

How to Teach This
=================

As with all C API functions, all the new APIs in this PEP will be documented
in the C API documentation, ideally under the :ref:`python:gilstate` section.
The existing ``PyGILState`` documentation should be updated accordingly to point
to the new APIs.

Examples
--------

These examples are here to help understand the APIs described in this PEP.
Ideally, they could be reused in the documentation.

Example: A Library Interface
****************************

Imagine that you're developing a C library for logging.
You might want to provide an API that allows users to log to a Python file
object.

With this PEP, you'd implement it like this:

.. code-block:: c

    int
    LogToPyFile(PyInterpreterWeakRef wref,
                PyObject *file,
                const char *text)
    {
        PyInterpreterRef ref;
        if (PyInterpreterWeakRef_AsStrong(wref, &ref) < 0) {
            // Python interpreter has shut down
            return -1;
        }

        if (PyThreadState_Ensure(ref) < 0) {
            PyInterpreterRef_Close(ref);
            puts("Out of memory.\n", stderr);
            return -1;
        }

        char *to_write = do_some_text_mutation(text);
        int res = PyFile_WriteString(to_write, file);
        free(to_write);
        PyErr_Print();

        PyThreadState_Release();
        PyInterpreterRef_Close(ref);
        return res < 0;
    }

If you were to use :c:func:`PyGILState_Ensure` for this case, then your
thread would hang if the interpreter were to be finalizing at that time!

Additionally, the API supports subinterpreters. If you were to assume that
the main interpreter created the file object, then your library wouldn't be safe to use
with file objects created by a subinterpreter.

Example: A Single-threaded Ensure
*********************************

This example shows acquiring a lock in a Python method.

If this were to be called from a daemon thread, then the interpreter could
hang the thread while reattaching the thread state, leaving us with the lock
held. Any future finalizer that wanted to acquire the lock would be deadlocked!

.. code-block:: c

    static PyObject *
    my_critical_operation(PyObject *self, PyObject *unused)
    {
        assert(PyThreadState_GetUnchecked() != NULL);
        PyInterpreterRef ref = PyInterpreterRef_Get();
        /* Temporarily hold a strong reference to ensure that the
           lock is released. */
        if (PyThreadState_Ensure(ref) < 0) {
            PyErr_NoMemory();
            PyInterpreterRef_Close(ref);
            return NULL;
        }

        Py_BEGIN_ALLOW_THREADS;
        acquire_some_lock();
        Py_END_ALLOW_THREADS;

        /* Do something while holding the lock.
           The interpreter won't finalize during this period. */
        // ...

        release_some_lock();
        PyThreadState_Release();
        PyInterpreterRef_Close(ref);
        Py_RETURN_NONE;
    }

Example: Transitioning From the Legacy Functions
************************************************

The following code uses the ``PyGILState`` APIs:

.. code-block:: c

    static int
    thread_func(void *arg)
    {
        PyGILState_STATE gstate = PyGILState_Ensure();
        /* It's not an issue in this example, but we just attached
           a thread state for the main interpreter. If my_method() was
           originally called in a subinterpreter, then we would be unable
           to safely interact with any objects from it. */
        if (PyRun_SimpleString("print(42)") < 0) {
            PyErr_Print();
        }
        PyGILState_Release(gstate);
        return 0;
    }

    static PyObject *
    my_method(PyObject *self, PyObject *unused)
    {
        PyThread_handle_t handle;
        PyThead_indent_t indent;

        if (PyThread_start_joinable_thread(thread_func, NULL, &ident, &handle) < 0) {
            return NULL;
        }
        Py_BEGIN_ALLOW_THREADS;
        PyThread_join_thread(handle);
        Py_END_ALLOW_THREADS;
        Py_RETURN_NONE;
    }

This is the same code, rewritten to use the new functions:

.. code-block:: c

    static int
    thread_func(void *arg)
    {
        PyInterpreterRef interp = (PyInterpreterRef)arg;
        if (PyThreadState_Ensure(interp) < 0) {
            PyInterpreterRef_Close(interp);
            return -1;
        }
        if (PyRun_SimpleString("print(42)") < 0) {
            PyErr_Print();
        }
        PyThreadState_Release();
        PyInterpreterRef_Close(interp);
        return 0;
    }

    static PyObject *
    my_method(PyObject *self, PyObject *unused)
    {
        PyThread_handle_t handle;
        PyThead_indent_t indent;

        PyInterpreterRef ref = PyInterpreterRef_Get();
        if (PyThread_start_joinable_thread(thread_func, (void *)ref, &ident, &handle) < 0) {
            PyInterpreterRef_Close(ref);
            return NULL;
        }
        Py_BEGIN_ALLOW_THREADS
        PyThread_join_thread(handle);
        Py_END_ALLOW_THREADS
        Py_RETURN_NONE;
    }


Example: A Daemon Thread
************************

Native daemon threads are still a use-case, and as such,
they can still be used with this API:

.. code-block:: c

    static int
    thread_func(void *arg)
    {
        PyInterpreterRef ref = (PyInterpreterRef)arg;
        if (PyThreadState_Ensure(ref) < 0) {
            PyInterpreterRef_Close(ref);
            return -1;
        }
        PyInterpreterRef_Close(ref);
        if (PyRun_SimpleString("print(42)") < 0) {
            PyErr_Print();
        }
        PyThreadState_Release();
        return 0;
    }

    static PyObject *
    my_method(PyObject *self, PyObject *unused)
    {
        PyThread_handle_t handle;
        PyThead_indent_t indent;

        PyInterpreterRef ref = PyInterpreterRef_Get();
        if (PyThread_start_joinable_thread(thread_func, (void *)ref, &ident, &handle) < 0) {
            PyInterpreterRef_Close(ref);
            return NULL;
        }
        Py_RETURN_NONE;
    }

Example: An Asynchronous Callback
*********************************

In some cases, the thread might not ever start, such as in a callback.
We can't use a strong reference here, because a strong reference would
deadlock the interpreter if it's not released.

.. code-block:: c

    typedef struct {
        PyInterpreterWeakRef wref;
    } ThreadData;

    static int
    async_callback(void *arg)
    {
        ThreadData *data = (ThreadData *)arg;
        PyInterpreterWeakRef wref = data->wref;
        PyInterpreterRef ref;
        if (PyInterpreterWeakRef_AsStrong(wref, &ref) < 0) {
            fputs("Python has shut down!\n", stderr);
            return -1;
        }

        if (PyThreadState_Ensure(ref) < 0) {
            PyInterpreterRef_Close(ref);
            return -1;
        }
        if (PyRun_SimpleString("print(42)") < 0) {
            PyErr_Print();
        }
        PyThreadState_Release();
        PyInterpreterRef_Close(ref);
        return 0;
    }

    static PyObject *
    setup_callback(PyObject *self, PyObject *unused)
    {
        // Weak reference to the interpreter. It won't wait on the callback
        // to finalize.
        ThreadData *tdata = PyMem_Malloc(sizeof(ThreadData));
        if (tdata == NULL) {
            PyErr_NoMemory();
            return NULL;
        }
        PyInterpreterWeakRef wref = PyInterpreterWeakRef_Get();
        tdata->wref = wref;
        register_callback(async_callback, tdata);

        Py_RETURN_NONE;
    }

Example: Calling Python Without a Callback Parameter
****************************************************

There are a few cases where callback functions don't take a callback parameter
(``void *arg``), so it's impossible to acquire a reference to any specific
interpreter. The solution to this problem is to acquire a reference to the main
interpreter through :c:func:`PyInterpreterState_AsStrong`.

But wait, won't that break with subinterpreters, per
:ref:`pep-788-subinterpreters-gilstate`? Fortunately, since the callback has
no callback parameter, it's not possible for the caller to pass any objects or
interpreter-specific data, so it's completely safe to choose the main
interpreter here.

.. code-block:: c

    static void
    call_python(void)
    {
        PyInterpreterRef ref;
        if (PyInterpreterState_AsStrong(PyInterpreterState_Main(), &ref) < 0) {
            fputs("Python has shut down!", stderr);
            return;
        }

        if (PyThreadState_Ensure(ref) < 0) {
            PyInterpreterRef_Close(ref);
            return -1;
        }
        if (PyRun_SimpleString("print(42)") < 0) {
            PyErr_Print();
        }
        PyThreadState_Release();
        PyInterpreterRef_Close(ref);
        return 0;
    }

Reference Implementation
========================

A reference implementation of this PEP can be found
at `python/cpython#133110 <https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/133110>`_.

Rejected Ideas
==============

Retrofiting the Existing Structures with Reference Counts
---------------------------------------------------------

Interpreter-State Pointers for Reference Counting
*************************************************

Originally, this PEP specified :c:func:`!PyInterpreterState_Hold`
and :c:func:`!PyInterpreterState_Release` for managing strong references
to an interpreter, alongside :c:func:`!PyInterpreterState_Lookup` which
converted interpreter IDs (weak references) to strong references.

In the end, this was rejected, primarily because it was needlessly
confusing. Interpreter states hadn't ever had a reference count prior, so
there was a lack of intuition about when and where something was a strong
reference. The :c:type:`PyInterpreterRef` and :c:type:`PyInterpreterWeakRef`
types seem a lot clearer.

Interpreter IDs for Reference Counting
**************************************

Some iterations of this API took an ``int64_t interp_id`` parameter instead of
``PyInterpreterState *interp``, because interpreter IDs cannot be concurrently
deleted and cause use-after-free violations. The reference counting APIs in
this PEP sidestep this issue anyway, but an interpreter ID have the advantage
of requiring less magic:

-  Nearly all existing interpreter APIs already return a :c:type:`PyInterpreterState`
   pointer, not an interpreter ID. Functions like
   :c:func:`PyThreadState_GetInterpreter` would have to be accompanied by
   frustrating calls to :c:func:`PyInterpreterState_GetID`.
-  Threads typically take a ``void *arg`` parameter, not an ``int64_t arg``.
   As such, passing a reference requires much less boilerplate
   for the user, because an additional structure definition or heap allocation
   would be needed to store the interpreter ID. This is especially an issue
   on 32-bit systems, where ``void *`` is too small for an ``int64_t``.
-  To retain usability, interpreter ID APIs would still need to keep a
   reference count, otherwise the interpreter could be finalizing before
   the native thread gets a chance to attach. The problem with using an
   interpreter ID is that the reference count has to be "invisible"; it
   must be tracked elsewhere in the interpreter, likely being *more*
   complex than :c:func:`PyInterpreterRef_Get`. There's also a lack
   of intuition that a standalone integer could have such a thing as
   a reference count.

.. _pep-788-activate-deactivate-instead:

Exposing an ``Activate``/``Deactivate`` API instead of ``Ensure``/``Clear``
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

In prior discussions of this API, it was
`suggested <https://discuss.python.org/t/83959/2>`_ to provide actual
:c:type:`PyThreadState` pointers in the API in an attempt to
make the ownership and lifetime of the thread state clearer:

    More importantly though, I think this makes it clearer who owns the thread
    state - a manually created one is controlled by the code that created it,
    and once it's deleted it can't be activated again.

This was ultimately rejected for two reasons:

-  The proposed API has closer usage to
   :c:func:`PyGILState_Ensure` & :c:func:`PyGILState_Release`, which helps
   ease the transition for old codebases.
-  It's `significantly easier <https://discuss.python.org/t/83959/15>`_
   for code-generators like Cython to use, as there isn't any additional
   complexity with tracking :c:type:`PyThreadState` pointers around.

Using ``PyStatus`` for the Return Value of ``PyThreadState_Ensure``
-------------------------------------------------------------------

In prior iterations of this API, :c:func:`PyThreadState_Ensure` returned a
:c:type:`PyStatus` instead of an integer to denote failures, which had the
benefit of providing an error message.

This was rejected because it's `not clear <https://discuss.python.org/t/83959/7>`_
that an error message would be all that useful; all the conceived use-cases
for this API wouldn't really care about a message indicating why Python
can't be invoked. As such, the API would only be needlessly harder to use,
which in turn would hurt the transition from :c:func:`PyGILState_Ensure`.

In addition, :c:type:`PyStatus` isn't commonly used in the C API. A few
functions related to interpreter initialization use it (simply because they
can't raise exceptions), and :c:func:`PyThreadState_Ensure` does not fall
under that category.

Open Issues
===========

.. _pep-788-deprecation:

When Should the GIL-state APIs be Removed?
------------------------------------------

:c:func:`PyGILState_Ensure` and :c:func:`PyGILState_Release` have been around
for over two decades, and it's expected that the migration will be difficult.
Currently, the plan is to remove them in 10 years (opposed to the 5 years
required by :pep:`387`), but this is subject to further discussion, as it's
unclear if that's enough (or too much) time.

In addition, it's unclear whether to remove them at all. A
:term:`soft deprecation <soft deprecated>` could reasonably fit for these
functions if it's determined that a full ``PyGILState`` removal would
be too disruptive for the ecosystem.
