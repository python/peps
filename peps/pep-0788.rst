Abstract
========

:c:func:`PyGILState_Ensure`, :c:func:`PyGILState_Release`, and other related
functions in the ``PyGILState`` family are the most common way to create
native threads that interact with Python. They have been the standard for over
twenty years (:pep:`311`). But, over time, these functions have
become problematic:

- They aren't safe for finalization, either causing the calling thread to hang or
  crashing it with a segmentation fault, preventing further execution.
- When they're called before finalization, they force the thread to be
  "daemon", meaning that an interpreter won't wait for it to reach any point
  of execution. This is mostly frustrating for developers, but can lead to
  deadlocks!
- Subinterpreters don't play nicely with them, because they all assume that
  the main interpreter is the only one that exists. A fresh thread (that is,
  has never had a thread state) that calls :c:func:`PyGILState_Ensure` will
  always be for the main interpreter.
- The term "GIL" in the name is quite confusing for users of free-threaded
  Python. There isn't a GIL, why do they still have to call it?

This PEP intends to fix all of these issues by providing two new functions,
:c:func:`PyThreadState_Ensure` and :c:func:`PyThreadState_Release`, as a more
correct and safer replacement for :c:func:`PyGILState_Ensure` and
:c:func:`PyGILState_Release`. For example:

.. code-block:: c

    if (PyThreadState_Ensure(interp) < 0) {
        fputs("Python is shutting down", stderr);
        return;
    }

    /* Interact with Python, without worrying about finalization. */
    // ...

    PyThreadState_Release();

This is achieved by introducing two concepts into the C API:

-  "Daemon" and "non-daemon" threads, similar to how it works in the
   :mod:`threading` module.
-  Interpreter reference counts which prevent an interpreter from finalizing.

In :c:func:`PyThreadState_Ensure`, both of these ideas are applied. The
calling thread is to store a reference to an interpreter via
:c:func:`PyInterpreterState_Hold`. :c:func:`PyInterpreterState_Hold`
increases the reference count of an interpreter, requiring the thread
to finish (by eventually calling :c:func:`PyThreadState_Release`) before
beginning finalization.

For example, creating a native thread with this API would look something
like this:

.. code-block:: c

    static PyObject *
    my_method(PyObject *self, PyObject *unused)
    {
        PyThread_handle_t handle;
        PyThead_indent_t indent;

        PyInterpreterState *interp = PyInterpreterState_Hold();
        if (PyThread_start_joinable_thread(thread_func, interp, &ident, &handle) < 0) {
            PyInterpreterState_Release(interp);
            return NULL;
        }
        /* The thread will always attach and finish, because we increased
           the reference count of the interpreter. */
        Py_RETURN_NONE;
    }

Motivation
==========

Native threads will always hang during finalization
---------------------------------------------------

Many codebases might need to call Python code in highly-asynchronous
situations where the interpreter is already finalizing, or might finalize, and
want to continue running code after the Python call. This desire has been
`brought up by users <https://discuss.python.org/t/78850/>`_.
For example, a callback that wants to call Python code might be invoked when:

- A kernel has finished running on a GPU.
- A network packet was received.
- A thread has quit, and a native library is executing static finalizers of
  thread local storage.

In the current C API, any non-Python thread (one not created via the
:mod:`threading` module) is considered to be "daemon", meaning that the interpreter
won't wait on that thread to finalize. Instead, the interpreter will hang the
thread when it goes to :term:`attach <attached thread state>` a :term:`thread state`,
making it unusable past that point. Attaching a thread state can happen at
any point when invoking Python, such as releasing the GIL in-between bytecode
instructions, or when a C function exits a :c:macro:`Py_BEGIN_ALLOW_THREADS`
block. (Note that hanging the thread is relatively new behavior; in prior
versions, the thread would terminate, but the issue is the same.)

This means that any non-Python thread may be terminated at any point, which
is severely limiting for users who want to do more than just execute Python
code in their stream of calls (for example, C++ executing finalizers in
*addition* to calling Python).

Using ``Py_IsFinalizing`` is insufficient
*****************************************

The :ref:`docs <python:gilstate>`
currently recommend :c:func:`Py_IsFinalizing` to guard against termination of
the thread:

    Calling this function from a thread when the runtime is finalizing will
    terminate the thread, even if the thread was not created by Python. You
    can use ``Py_IsFinalizing()`` or ``sys.is_finalizing()`` to check if the
    interpreter is in process of being finalized before calling this function
    to avoid unwanted termination.

Unfortunately, this isn't correct, because of time-of-call to time-of-use
issues; the interpreter might not be finalizing during the call to
:c:func:`Py_IsFinalizing`, but it might start finalizing immediately afterwards, which
would cause the attachment of a thread state (typically via
:c:func:`PyGILState_Ensure`) to hang the thread.

Daemon threads can cause finalization deadlocks
***********************************************

When acquiring locks, it's extremely important to detach the thread state to
prevent deadlocks. This is true on both the with-GIL and free-threaded builds.
When the GIL is enabled, a deadlock can occur pretty easily when acquiring a
lock if the GIL wasn't released, and lock-ordering deadlocks can still occur
free-threaded builds if the thread state wasn't detached.

So, all code that needs to work with locks need to detach the thread state.
In C, this is almost always done via :c:macro:`Py_BEGIN_ALLOW_THREADS` and
:c:macro:`Py_END_ALLOW_THREADS`, in a code block that looks something like this:

.. code-block:: c

    Py_BEGIN_ALLOW_THREADS
    acquire_lock();
    Py_END_ALLOW_THREADS

Again, in a daemon thread, :c:macro:`Py_END_ALLOW_THREADS` will hang the thread
if the interpreter is finalizing. But, :c:macro:`Py_BEGIN_ALLOW_THREADS` will
*not* hang the thread; the lock will be acquired, and *then* the thread will
be hung! Once that happens, nothing can try to acquire that lock without
deadlocking. The main thread will continue to run finalizers past that point,
though. If any of those finalizers try to acquire the lock, deadlock ensues.

This affects CPython itself, and there's not much that can be done
to fix it. For example, `python/cpython#129536 <https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/129536>`_
remarks that the :mod:`ssl` module can emit a fatal error when used at
finalization, because a daemon thread got hung while holding the lock. There
are workarounds for this for pure-Python code, but native threads don't have
such an option.

.. _pep-788-hanging-compat:

We can't change finalization behavior for ``PyGILState_Ensure``
***************************************************************

There will always have to be a point in a Python program where
:c:func:`PyGILState_Ensure` can no longer acquire the GIL (or more correctly,
attach a thread state). If the interpreter is long dead, then Python
obviously can't give a thread a way to invoke it.
:c:func:`PyGILState_Ensure` doesn't have any meaningful way to return a
failure, so it has no choice but to terminate the thread or emit a fatal
error, as noted in `python/cpython#124622 <https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/124622>`_:

    I think a new GIL acquisition and release C API would be needed. The way
    the existing ones get used in existing C code is not amenible to suddenly
    bolting an error state onto; none of the existing C code is written that
    way. After the call they always just assume they have the GIL and can
    proceed. The API was designed as "it'll block and only return once it has
    the GIL" without any other option.

For this reason, we can't make any real changes to how :c:func:`PyGILState_Ensure`
works for finalization, because it would break existing code. Similarly, threads
created with the existing C API will have to remain daemon, because extensions
that implement native threads aren't guaranteed to work during finalization.

The existing APIs are broken and misleading
-------------------------------------------

There are currently two public ways for a user to create and attach their own
:term:`thread state`; manual use of :c:func:`PyThreadState_New` & :c:func:`PyThreadState_Swap`,
and :c:func:`PyGILState_Ensure`. The latter, :c:func:`PyGILState_Ensure`,
is `significantly more common <https://grep.app/search?q=pygilstate_ensure>`_.

``PyGILState_Ensure`` generally crashes during finalization
***********************************************************

At the time of writing, the current behavior of :c:func:`PyGILState_Ensure` does not
match the documentation. Instead of hanging the thread during finalization
as previously noted, it's extremely common for it to crash with a segmentation
fault. This is a `known issue <https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/124619>`_
that could, in theory, be fixed in CPython, but it's definitely worth noting
here. Incidentally, acceptance and implementation of this PEP will likely fix
the existing crashes caused by :c:func:`PyGILState_Ensure`.

The term "GIL" is tricky for free-threading
*******************************************

A large issue with the term "GIL" in the C API is that it is semantically
misleading. This was noted in `python/cpython#127989
<https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/127989>`_,
created by the authors of this PEP:

    The biggest issue is that for free-threading, there is no GIL, so users
    erroneously call the C API inside ``Py_BEGIN_ALLOW_THREADS`` blocks or
    omit ``PyGILState_Ensure`` in fresh threads.

Since Python 3.12, it is an :term:`attached thread state` that lets a thread
invoke the C API. On with-GIL builds, holding an attached thread state
implies holding the GIL, so only one thread can have one at a time. Free-threaded
builds achieve the effect of multi-core parallism while remaining
ackwards-compatible by simply removing that limitation: threads still need a
thread state (and thus need to call :c:func:`PyGILState_Ensure`), but they
don't need to wait on one another to do so.

Subinterpreters don't work with ``PyGILState_Ensure``
-----------------------------------------------------

As noted in the :ref:`documentation <python:gilstate>`,
``PyGILState`` APIs aren't officially supported in subinterpreters:

    Note that the ``PyGILState_*`` functions assume there is only one global
    interpreter (created automatically by ``Py_Initialize()``). Python
    supports the creation of additional interpreters (using
    ``Py_NewInterpreter()``), but mixing multiple interpreters and the
    ``PyGILState_*`` API is unsupported.

More technically, this is because ``PyGILState_Ensure`` doesn't have any way
to know which interpreter created the thread, and as such, it has to assume
that it was the main interpreter. There isn't any way to detect this at
runtime, so spurious races are bound to come up in threads created by
subinterpreters, because synchronization for the wrong interpreter will be
used on objects shared between the threads.


Interpreters can concurrently shut down
***************************************

The other way of creating a native thread that can invoke Python,
:c:func:`PyThreadState_New` / :c:func:`PyThreadState_Swap`, is a lot better
for supporting subinterpreters (because :c:func:`PyThreadState_New` takes an
explicit interpreter, rather than assuming that the main interpreter was intended),
but is still limited by the current API.

In particular, subinterpreters typically have a much shorter lifetime than the
main interpreter, and as such, there's not necessarily a guarantee that a
:c:type:`PyInterpreterState` (acquired by :c:func:`PyInterpreterState_Get`)
passed to a fresh thread will still be alive. Similarly, a
:c:type:`PyInterpreterState` pointer could have been replaced with a *new*
interpreter, causing all sorts of unknown issues. They are also subject to
all the finalization related hanging mentioned previously.

Rationale
=========

This PEP includes several new APIs that intend to fix all of the issues stated
above.

Replacing the old APIs
----------------------

As made clear in Motivation_, ``PyGILState`` is already pretty buggy, and
even if it was magically fixed, the current behavior of hanging the thread is
beyond repair. In turn, this PEP intends to completely deprecate the existing
``PyGILState`` APIs and provide better alternatives. However, even if this PEP
is rejected, all of the APIs can be replaced with more correct ``PyThreadState``
functions in the current C API:

- :c:func:`PyGILState_Ensure`: :c:func:`PyThreadState_Swap` & :c:func:`PyThreadState_New`
- :c:func:`PyGILState_Release`: :c:func:`PyThreadState_Clear` & :c:func:`PyThreadState_Delete`
- :c:func:`PyGILState_GetThisThreadState`: :c:func:`PyThreadState_Get`
- :c:func:`PyGILState_Check`: ``PyThreadState_GetUnchecked() != NULL``

This PEP specifies a ten-year deprecation for these functions (while remaining
in the stable ABI), primarily because it's expected that the migration won't be
seamless, due to the new requirement of storing an interpreter state. The
exact details of this deprecation are currently unclear, see
:ref:`pep-788-deprecation`.

A light layer of magic
----------------------

The APIs proposed by this PEP intentionally have a layer of abstraction that is
hidden from the user and offloads complexity onto CPython. This is done
primarily to help ease the transition from ``PyGILState`` for existing
codebases, and for ease-of-use to those who provide wrappers the C API, such
as Cython or PyO3.

In particular, the API hides details about the lifetime of the thread state
and most of the details with interpreter references.

See also :ref:`pep-788-activate-deactivate-instead`.

Bikeshedding and the ``PyThreadState`` namespace
------------------------------------------------

To solve the issue with "GIL" terminology, the new functions described by this
PEP intended as replacements for ``PyGILState`` will go under the existing
``PyThreadState`` namespace. In Python 3.14, the documentation has been
updated to switch over to terms like
:term:`"attached thread state" <attached thread state>` instead of
:term:`"global interpreter lock" <global interpreter lock>`, so this namespace
seems to fit well for this PEP.

Preventing interpreter finalization with references
---------------------------------------------------

Several iterations of this API have taken an approach where
:c:func:`PyThreadState_Ensure` can return a failure based on the state of
the interpreter. Instead, this PEP takes an approach where an interpreter
keeps track of the number of non-daemon threads, which inherently prevents
it from beginning finalization.

The main upside with this approach is that there's more consistency with
attaching threads. Using an interpreter reference from the calling thread
keeps the interpreter from finalizing before the thread starts, ensuring
that it always works. An approach that were to return a failure based on
the start-time of the thread could cause spurious issues.

In the case where it is useful to let the interpreter finalize, such as in
an asynchronous callback where there's no guarantee that the thread will start,
strong references to an interpreter can be acquired through
:c:func:`PyInterpreterState_Lookup`.

Specification
=============

Daemon and non-daemon threads
-----------------------------

This PEP introduces the concept of non-daemon thread states. By default, all
threads created without the :mod:`threading` module will hang when trying to
attach a thread state for a finalizing interpreter (in fact, daemon threads
that *are* created with the :mod:`threading` module will hang in the same
way). This generally happens when a thread calls :c:func:`PyEval_RestoreThread`
or in between bytecode instructions, based on :func:`sys.setswitchinterval`.

A new, internal field will be added to the ``PyThreadState`` structure that
determines if the thread is daemon. Before finalization, an interpreter
will wait until all non-daemon threads call :c:func:`PyThreadState_Delete`.

For backwards compatibility, all thread states created by existing APIs,
including :c:func:`PyGILState_Ensure`, will remain daemon by default.
See :ref:`pep-788-hanging-compat`.

.. c:function:: int PyThreadState_SetDaemon(int is_daemon)

    Set the :term:`attached thread state` as non-daemon or daemon.

    The attached thread state must not be the main thread for the
    interpreter. All thread states created without
    :c:func:`PyThreadState_Ensure` are daemon by default.

    If the thread state is non-daemon, then the current interpreter will wait
    for this thread to finish before shutting down. See also
    :attr:`threading.Thread.daemon`.

    Return zero on success, non-zero *without* an exception set on failure.

Interpreter reference counting
------------------------------

Internally, an interpreter will have to keep track of the number of
non-daemon native threads, which will determine when an interpreter can
finalize. This is done to prevent use-after-free crashes in
:c:func:`PyThreadState_Ensure` for interpreters with short lifetimes, and
to remove needless layers of synchronization between the calling thread and
the started thread.

An interpreter state returned by :c:func:`Py_NewInterpreter` (or really,
:c:func:`PyInterpreterState_New`) will start with a native thread countdown.
For simplicity's sake, this will be referred to as a reference count.
A non-zero reference count prevents the interpreter from finalizing.

.. c:function:: PyInterpreterState *PyInterpreterState_Hold(void)

    Similar to :c:func:`PyInterpreterState_Get`, but returns a strong
    reference to the interpreter (meaning, it has its reference count
    incremented by one, allowing the returned interpreter state to be safely
    accessed by another thread, because it will be prevented from finalizing).

    This function is generally meant to be used in tandem with
    :c:func:`PyThreadState_Ensure`.

    The caller must have an :term:`attached thread state`. This function
    cannot return ``NULL``. Failures are always a fatal error.

.. c:function:: PyInterpreterState *PyInterpreterState_Lookup(int64_t interp_id)

    Similar to :c:func:`PyInterpreterState_Hold`, but looks up an interpreter
    based on an ID (see :c:func:`PyInterpreterState_GetID`). This has the
    benefit of allowing the interpreter to finalize in cases where the thread
    might not start, such as inside of an asynchronous callback.

    This function will return ``NULL`` without an exception set on failure.
    If the return value is non-``NULL``, then the returned interpreter will be
    prevented from finalizing until the reference is released by
    :c:func:`PyThreadState_Release` or :c:func:`PyInterpreterState_Release`.

    Returning ``NULL`` typically means that the interpreter is at a point
    where threads cannot start, or no longer exists.

    The caller does not need to have an :term:`attached thread state`.

.. c:function:: void PyInterpreterState_Release(PyInterpreterState *interp)

    Decrement the reference count of the interpreter, as was incremented by
    :c:func:`PyInterpreterState_Hold` or :c:func:`PyInterpreterState_Lookup`.

    This function cannot fail, other than with a fatal error. The caller does
    not need to have an :term:`attached thread state` for *interp*.

Ensuring and releasing thread states
------------------------------------

This proposal includes two new high-level threading APIs that intend to
replace :c:func:`PyGILState_Ensure` and :c:func:`PyGILState_Release`.

.. c:function:: int PyThreadState_Ensure(PyInterpreterState *interp)

    Ensure that the thread has an :term:`attached thread state` for *interp*,
    and thus can safely invoke that interpreter. It is OK to call this
    function if the thread already has an attached thread state, as long as
    there is a subsequent call to :c:func:`PyThreadState_Release` that matches
    this one.

    The reference to the interpreter *interp* is stolen by this function.
    As such, *interp* should have been acquired by
    :c:func:`PyInterpreterState_Hold`.

    Thread states created by this function are non-daemon by default. See
    :c:func:`PyThreadState_SetDaemon`. If the calling thread already has an
    attached thread state that matches *interp*, then this function
    will mark the existing thread state as non-daemon and return. It will
    be restored to its prior daemon status upon the next
    :c:func:`PyThreadState_Release` call.

    Return zero on success, and non-zero with the old attached thread state
    restored (which may have been ``NULL``).

.. c:function:: void PyThreadState_Release()

    Release the :term:`attached thread state` set by
    :c:func:`PyThreadState_Ensure`. Any thread state that was set prior
    to the original call to :c:func:`PyThreadState_Ensure` will be restored.

    This function cannot fail, but may hang the thread if the
    attached thread state prior to the original :c:func:`!PyThreadState_Ensure`
    was daemon and the interpreter was finalized.

Deprecation of ``PyGILState`` APIs
----------------------------------

This PEP deprecates all of the existing ``PyGILState`` APIs in favor of the
new ``PyThreadState`` APIs for the reasons given in the Motivation_. Namely:

- :c:func:`PyGILState_Ensure`: use :c:func:`PyThreadState_Ensure` instead.
- :c:func:`PyGILState_Release`: use :c:func:`PyThreadState_Release` instead.
- :c:func:`PyGILState_GetThisThreadState`: use :c:func:`PyThreadState_Get` or
  :c:func:`PyThreadState_GetUnchecked` instead.
- :c:func:`PyGILState_Check`: use ``PyThreadState_GetUnchecked() != NULL``
  instead.

All of the ``PyGILState`` APIs are to be removed from the non-limited C API in
Python 3.25. They will remain available in the stable ABI for compatibility.

Backwards Compatibility
=======================

This PEP specifies a breaking change with the removal of all the
``PyGILState`` APIs from the public headers of the non-limited C API in 10
years (Python 3.25).

Security Implications
=====================

This PEP has no known security implications.

How to Teach This
=================

As with all C API functions, all the new APIs in this PEP will be documented
in the C API documentation, ideally under the :ref:`python:gilstate` section.
The existing ``PyGILState`` documentation should be updated accordingly to point
to the new APIs.

Examples
--------

These examples are here to help understand the APIs described in this PEP.
Ideally, they could be reused in the documentation.

Single-threaded example
***********************

This example shows acquiring a lock in a Python method.

If this were to be called from a daemon thread, then the interpreter could
hang the thread while reattaching the thread state, leaving us with the lock
held. Any future finalizer that wanted to acquire the lock would be deadlocked!

.. code-block:: c

    static PyObject *
    my_critical_operation(PyObject *self, PyObject *unused)
    {
        assert(PyThreadState_GetUnchecked() != NULL);
        PyInterpreterState *interp = PyInterpreterState_Hold();
        /* Temporarily make this thread non-daemon to ensure that the
           lock is released. */
        if (PyThreadState_Ensure(interp) < 0) {
            PyErr_SetString(PyExc_PythonFinalizationError,
                            "interpreter is shutting down");
            return NULL;
        }

        Py_BEGIN_ALLOW_THREADS;
        acquire_some_lock();
        Py_END_ALLOW_THREADS;

        /* Do something while holding the lock */
        // ...

        release_some_lock();
        PyThreadState_Release();
        Py_RETURN_NONE;
    }

Transitioning from old functions
********************************

The following code uses the old ``PyGILState`` APIs:

.. code-block:: c

    static int
    thread_func(void *arg)
    {
        PyGILState_STATE gstate = PyGILState_Ensure();
        /* It's not an issue in this example, but we just attached
           a thread state for the main interpreter. If my_method() was
           originally called in a subinterpreter, then we would be unable
           to safely interact with any objects from it. */
        if (PyRun_SimpleString("print(42)") < 0) {
            PyErr_Print();
        }
        PyGILState_Release(gstate);
        return 0;
    }

    static PyObject *
    my_method(PyObject *self, PyObject *unused)
    {
        PyThread_handle_t handle;
        PyThead_indent_t indent;

        if (PyThread_start_joinable_thread(thread_func, NULL, &ident, &handle) < 0) {
            return NULL;
        }
        Py_BEGIN_ALLOW_THREADS;
        PyThread_join_thread(handle);
        Py_END_ALLOW_THREADS;
        Py_RETURN_NONE;
    }

This is the same code, updated to use the new functions:

.. code-block:: c

    static int
    thread_func(void *arg)
    {
        PyInterpreterState *interp = (PyInterpreterState *)arg;
        if (PyThreadState_Ensure(interp) < 0) {
            fputs("Cannot talk to Python", stderr);
            return -1;
        }
        if (PyRun_SimpleString("print(42)") < 0) {
            PyErr_Print();
        }
        PyThreadState_Release();
        return 0;
    }

    static PyObject *
    my_method(PyObject *self, PyObject *unused)
    {
        PyThread_handle_t handle;
        PyThead_indent_t indent;

        PyInterpreterState *interp = PyInterpreterState_Hold();
        if (PyThread_start_joinable_thread(thread_func, interp, &ident, &handle) < 0) {
            PyInterpreterState_Release(interp);
            return NULL;
        }
        Py_BEGIN_ALLOW_THREADS
        PyThread_join_thread(handle);
        Py_END_ALLOW_THREADS
        Py_RETURN_NONE;
    }


Daemon thread example
*********************

Native daemon threads are still a use-case, and as such,
they can still be used with this API:

.. code-block:: c

    static int
    thread_func(void *arg)
    {
        PyInterpreterState *interp = (PyInterpreterState *)arg;
        if (PyThreadState_Ensure(interp) < 0) {
            fputs("Cannot talk to Python", stderr);
            return -1;
        }
        (void)PyThreadState_SetDaemon(1);
        if (PyRun_SimpleString("print(42)") < 0) {
            PyErr_Print();
        }
        PyThreadState_Release();
        return 0;
    }

    static PyObject *
    my_method(PyObject *self, PyObject *unused)
    {
        PyThread_handle_t handle;
        PyThead_indent_t indent;

        PyInterpreterState *interp = PyInterpreterState_Hold();
        if (PyThread_start_joinable_thread(thread_func, interp, &ident, &handle) < 0) {
            PyInterpreterState_Release(interp);

Asynchronous callback example
*****************************

As stated in the Motivation_, there are many cases where it's desirable
to call Python in an asynchronous callback. In such cases, it's not safe to
call :c:func:`PyInterpreterState_Hold`, because it's not guaranteed that
:c:func:`PyThreadState_Ensure` will ever be called.
If not, finalization becomes deadlocked.

This scenario requires using :c:func:`PyInterpreterState_Lookup` instead,
which only prevents finalization once the lookup has been made.

For example:

.. code-block:: c

    typedef struct {
        int64_t interp_id;
    } pyrun_t;

    static int
    async_callback(void *arg)
    {
        pyrun_t *data = (pyrun_t *)arg;
        PyInterpreterState *interp = PyInterpreterState_Lookup(data->interp_id);
        PyMem_RawFree(data);
        if (interp == NULL) {
            fputs("Python has shut down", stderr);
            return -1;
        }
        if (PyThreadState_Ensure(interp) < 0) {
            fputs("Cannot talk to Python", stderr);
            return -1;
        }
        if (PyRun_SimpleString("print(42)") < 0) {
            PyErr_Print();
        }
        PyThreadState_Release();
        return 0;
    }

    static PyObject *
    setup_callback(PyObject *self, PyObject *unused)
    {
        PyThread_handle_t handle;
        PyThead_indent_t indent;

        pyrun_t *data = PyMem_RawMalloc(sizeof(pyrun_t));
        if (data == NULL) {
            return PyErr_NoMemory();
        }
        // Weak reference to the interpreter. It won't wait on the callback
        // to finalize.
        data->interp_id = PyInterpreterState_GetID(PyInterpreterState_Get());
        register_callback(async_callback, data);

        Py_RETURN_NONE;
    }

Rejected Ideas
==============

Using an interpreter ID instead of a interpreter state for ``PyThreadState_Ensure``
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some iterations of this API took an ``int64_t interp_id`` parameter instead of
``PyInterpreterState *interp``, because interpreter IDs cannot be concurrently
deleted and cause use-after-free violations. :c:func:`PyInterpreterState_Hold`
fixes this issue anyway, but an interpreter ID does have the benefit of
requiring less magic in the implementation, but has several downsides:

-  Nearly all existing interpreter APIs already return a :c:type:`PyInterpreterState`
   pointer, not an interpreter ID. Functions like
   :c:func:`PyThreadState_GetInterpreter` would have to be accompanied by
   frustrating calls to :c:func:`PyInterpreterState_GetID`. There's also
   no existing way to go from an ``int64_t`` back to a
   :c:expr:`PyInterpreterState *`, and providing such an API would come
   with its own set of design problems.
-  Threads typically take a ``void *arg`` parameter, not an ``int64_t arg``.
   As such, passing an interpreter pointer requires much less boilerplate
   for the user, because an additional structure definition or heap allocation
   would be needed to store the interpreter ID. This is especially an issue
   on 32-bit systems, where ``void *`` is too small for an ``int64_t``.
-  To retain usability, interpreter ID APIs would still need to keep a
   reference count, otherwise the interpreter could be finalizing before
   the native thread gets a chance to attach. The problem with using an
   interpreter ID is that the reference count has to be "invisible"; it
   must be tracked elsewhere in the interpreter, likely being *more*
   complex than :c:func:`PyInterpreterState_Hold`. There's also a lack
   of intuition that a standalone integer could have such a thing as
   a reference count. :c:func:`PyInterpreterState_Lookup` sidesteps this
   problem because the reference count is always associated with the returned
   interpreter state, not the integer ID.

.. _pep-788-activate-deactivate-instead:

Exposing an ``Activate``/``Deactivate`` API instead of ``Ensure``/``Clear``
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

In prior discussions of this API, it was
`suggested <https://discuss.python.org/t/83959/2>`_ to provide actual
:c:type:`PyThreadState` pointers in the API in an attempt to
make the ownership and lifetime of the thread state clearer:

    More importantly though, I think this makes it clearer who owns the thread
    state - a manually created one is controlled by the code that created it,
    and once it's deleted it can't be activated again.

This was ultimately rejected for two reasons:

-  The proposed API has closer usage to
   :c:func:`PyGILState_Ensure` & :c:func:`PyGILState_Release`, which helps
   ease the transition for old codebases.
-  It's `significantly easier <https://discuss.python.org/t/83959/15>`_
   for code-generators like Cython to use, as there isn't any additional
   complexity with tracking :c:type:`PyThreadState` pointers around.

Using ``PyStatus`` for the return value of ``PyThreadState_Ensure``
-------------------------------------------------------------------

In prior iterations of this API, :c:func:`PyThreadState_Ensure` returned a
:c:type:`PyStatus` instead of an integer to denote failures, which had the
benefit of providing an error message.

This was rejected because it's `not clear <https://discuss.python.org/t/83959/7>`_
that an error message would be all that useful; all the conceived use-cases
for this API wouldn't really care about a message indicating why Python
can't be invoked. As such, the API would only be needlessly harder to use,
which in turn would hurt the transition from :c:func:`PyGILState_Ensure`.

In addition, :c:type:`PyStatus` isn't commonly used in the C API. A few
functions related to interpreter initialization use it (simply because they
can't raise exceptions), and :c:func:`PyThreadState_Ensure` does not fall
under that category.

Open Issues
===========

.. _pep-788-deprecation:

When should the legacy APIs be removed?
---------------------------------------

:c:func:`PyGILState_Ensure` and :c:func:`PyGILState_Release` have been around
for over two decades, and it's expected that the migration will be difficult.
Currently, the plan is to remove them in 10 years (opposed to the 5 years
required by :pep:`387`), but this is subject to further discussion, as it's
unclear if that's enough (or too much) time.

In addition, it's unclear whether to remove them at all. A
:term:`soft deprecation <soft deprecated>` could reasonably fit for these
functions if it's determined that a full ``PyGILState`` removal would
be too disruptive for the ecosystem.
