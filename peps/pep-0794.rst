Abstract
========

This PEP proposes extending the core metadata specification for Python
packaging to include a new, repeatable field named ``Import-Name`` to record
the import names that a project owns/provides once installed. A new key named
``import-names`` will be added to the ``[project]`` table in
``pyproject.toml`` for providing the values for the new core metadata field.
This also leads to the introduction of core metadata version 2.5.


Motivation
==========

In Python packaging there is no requirement that a project name match the
name(s) that you can import for that project. As such, there is no clean,
easy, accurate way to go from import name to project name and vice-versa.
This can make it difficult for tools that try to help people in discovering
the right project to install when they know the import name or knowing what
import names a project will provide once installed.

As an example, a code editor may detect a user has an unsatisfied import in a
selected virtual environment. But with no way to reliably know what import
names various projects provide, the code editor cannot accurately
provide a user with a list of potential projects to install to satisfy that
import requirement (e.g. it is not obvious that ``import PIL`` very likely
implies the user wants the `Pillow project
<https://pypi.org/project/pillow/>`__ installed). This also applies to when a
user vaguely remembers the project name but does not remember the import
name(s) and would have their memory jogged when seeing a list of import names
a package provides. Finally, tools would be able to notify users what import
names will become available once they install a project.

It may also help with spam detection. If a project specifies the same import
names as a very popular project it can act as a signal to take a closer look
at the validity of the less popular project. A project found to be lying
about what import names it provides would be another signal.


Rationale
=========

This PEP proposes extending the packaging :ref:`packaging:core-metadata` so
that project owners can specify the highest-level import names that a project
provides and owns if installed.

By keeping the information to the import names a project would own if
installed, it makes it clear which project maps directly to what import name
once the project is installed.

Putting this metadata in the core metadata means the data is (potentially)
served independently of any sdist or wheel by an index server. That negates
needing to come up with another way to expose the metadata to tools to avoid
having to download an entire e.g. wheel.

Having this metadata be the same across all release artifacts would allow for
projects to only have to check a single file's core metadata to get all
possible import names instead of checking all the released files. This also
means one does not need to worry if a file is missing when reading the core
metadata or one can work solely from an sdist if the metadata is provided. As
well, it simplifies having a ``project.import-names`` key in
``pyproject.toml`` by having it be consistent for the entire project version
and not unique per released file for the same version.

This PEP is not overly strict on what to (not) list in the proposed metadata on
purpose. Having build back-ends verify that a project is accurately following
a specification that is somehow strict about what can be listed would be near
impossible to get right due to how flexible Python's import system is. As such,
this PEP only requires that valid import names be used and that projects don't
lie (and it is acknowledged the latter requirements cannot be validated
programmatically).

Various other attempts have been made to solve this, but they all have to
make various trade-offs. For instance, one could download every wheel for
every project release and look at what files are provided via the
:ref:`packaging:binary-distribution-format`, but that's a lot of CPU and
bandwidth for something that is static information (although tricks can be
used to lessen the data requests such as using HTTP range requests to only
read the table of contents of the zip file). This sort of calculation is also
currently repeated by everyone independently instead of having the metadata
hosted by a central index server like PyPI. It also doesn't work for sdists
as the structure of the wheel isn't known yet, and so inferring the structure
of the code installed isn't known yet. As well, these solutions are not
necessarily accurate as it is based on inference instead of being explicitly
provided by the project owners.


Specification
=============

Because this PEP introduces a new field to the core metadata, it bumps the
latest core metadata version to 2.5.

The ``Import-Name`` field is a "multiple uses" field. Each entry of
``Import-Name`` MUST be a valid import name. The names specified in
``Import-Name`` MUST be importable when the project is installed on *some*
platform for the same version of the project (i.e. the metadata MUST be
consistent across all sdists and wheels for a project release). This does
imply that the information isn't specific to the distribution artifact it is
found in, but for the release version the distribution artifact belongs to.

Projects are not expected to list every single import name that is provided.
Instead, projects SHOULD list the highest-level/shortest import name that the
project would "own" when installed. For example, if you install a project
that has a single package named ``myproj`` which itself has multiple
submodules, the expectation is only ``myproj`` would be listed in
``Import-Name`` and not every submodule. If a project is part of a namespace
package named ``ns`` and it provides a subpackage called ``ns.myproj`` (i.e.
``ns.myproj.__init__`` exists), then ``ns.myproj`` should be listed in
``Import-Name``, but NOT ``ns`` alone as that is not "owned" by the project
upon installation (i.e. other projects can be installed which also contribute to
``ns``).

If a project chooses not to provide any ``Import-Name`` entries, tools MAY
assume the import name matches the project name (including de-normalization of
the project name, e.g. ``my-proj`` as ``my_proj``).

The :ref:`declaring-project-metadata` will gain an ``import-names`` key. It
will be an array of strings that stores what will be written out to
``Import-Name``. Build back-ends MAY support dynamically calculating the
value on the user's behalf if desired, if the user declares the key in
``project.dynamic``.


Examples
--------

`In httpx 0.28.1
<https://pypi-browser.org/package/httpx/httpx-0.28.1-py3-none-any.whl>`__ ,
an entry for the ``httpx`` package.

`In pytest 8.3.5
<https://pypi-browser.org/package/pytest/pytest-8.3.5-py3-none-any.whl>`__
there would be 3 expected entries:

1. ``_pytest``
2. ``py``
3. ``pytest``

In `azure-mgmt-search 9.1.0
<https://pypi-browser.org/package/azure-mgmt-search/azure_mgmt_search-9.1.0-py3-none-any.whl>`__,
there should be a single entry for ``azure.mgmt.search``.


Backwards Compatibility
=======================

As this is a new field for the core metadata and a new core metadata version,
there should be no backwards compatibility concerns.


Security Implications
=====================

Tools should treat the metadata as potentially inaccurate. As such, any
decisions made based on the provided metadata should be assumed to be
malicious in some way.


How to Teach This
=================

Project owners should be taught that they can now record what namespaces
their project provides. They should be told that if their project has a
non-obvious namespace from the file structure of the project that they should
specify the appropriate information. They should have it explained to them
that they should use the shortest name possible that appropriately explains
what the project provides (i.e. what the specification requires to be
recorded).

Users of projects don't necessarily need to know about this new metadata.
While they may be exposed to it via tooling, the details of where that data
came from isn't critical. It's possible they may come across it if an index
server exposed it (e.g., listed the values from ``Import-Name`` and marked
whether the file structure backed up the claims the metadata makes), but that
still wouldn't require users to know the technical details of this PEP.


Reference Implementation
========================

https://github.com/brettcannon/packaging/tree/pep-794 is a branch to update
'packaging' to support this PEP.


Rejected Ideas
==============

Re-purpose the ``Provides`` field
----------------------------------

Introduced in metadata version 1.1 and deprecated in 1.2, the ``Provides``
field was meant to provide similar information, except for **all** names
provided by a project instead of the distinguishing namespaces as this PEP
proposes. Based on that difference and the fact that ``Provides`` is
deprecated and thus could be ignored by preexisting code, the decision was
made to go with a new field.


Name the field ``Namespace``
----------------------------

While the term "namespace" name is technically accurate from an import
perspective, it could be confused with implicit namespace packages.


Serving the ``RECORD`` file
---------------------------

During `discussions about a pre-PEP version
<https://discuss.python.org/t/90506/>`__ of this
PEP, it was suggested that the ``RECORD`` file from wheels be served from
index servers instead of this new metadata. That would have the benefit of
being implementable immediately. But in order to provide the equivalent
information there would be necessary inference based on the file structure of
what would be installed by the wheel. That could lead to inaccurate
information. It also doesn't support sdists.

In the end a `poll
<https://discuss.python.org/t/90506/46>`__ was
held and the approach this PEP takes won out.


Be more prescriptive in what projects specify
---------------------------------------------

An earlier version of this PEP was much more strict in what could be put into
``Import-Name``. This included turning some "SHOULD" guidelines into "MUST"
requirements and being specific about how to calculate what a project "owned".
In the end it was decided that was too restrictive and risked being implemented
incorrectly or the spec being unexpectedy too strict.

Since the metadata was never expected to be exhaustive as it can't be verified
to be, the looser spec that is currently in this PEP was chosen instead.
