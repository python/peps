Abstract
========

This PEP proposes the creation of an official read-only mirror of the
`CPython Git repository <https://github.com/python/cpython>`_,
currently hosted on GitHub (since :pep:`512`), on an additional hosting
platform to improve resilience.


Motivation
==========

The authors believe that mirroring the repository on an alternative
platform will limit
`vendor lock-in <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in>`_  and improve
the security, resilience, and accessibility of CPython without impacting the
current development workflow.
Currently, the up-to-date CPython source code is officially available only
on GitHub, following the retirement of `hg.python.org <https://hg.python.org/>`_.
The idea of a mirror was originally noted in :pep:`512#the-fate-of-hg-python-org`.

.. note::

    The standard clone of a repository does not pull all information, see
    the `Git documentation <https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone#Documentation/git-clone.txt---mirror>`_
    for more information.

Many open source projects provide mirrors, for example:
`GNOME <https://github.com/GNOME>`_, `KDE <https://github.com/KDE?>`_,
`Git <https://github.com/git/git>`_, `GCC <https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc>`_,
`Linux <https://gitlab.com/linux-kernel/linux>`_, `curl <https://codeberg.org/curl/curl-mirror>`_,
`FreeBSD <https://gitlab.com/FreeBSD/freebsd-src>`_, and `OpenBSD <https://github.com/openbsd/src>`_.

Relying on a single storage provider carries the risk that, if the provider
goes down, all data stored on the platform could be lost.
This is similar to maintaining backups of personal data (photos, documents, etc.).

In the event of a temporary outage, local development can still continue as
one can pull the most recent state of the repository from the mirror.
In the event of a permanent outage, having a mirror with the
``python`` namespace would allow for a smoother migration to a new
contribution platform as many things would already be set up, and
a copy of the up-to-date source would be available.

Some contributors prefer using open-source platforms to develop open source projects.
Since `GitHub <github.com>`_ is not open source, a mirror would allow us to
address this concern. Mirrors improve accessibility for contributors in regions
where GitHub may be blocked [#ghcens]_ or slow.


Rationale
=========

The mirror is **not** intended to replace the host for contributions
(issues, pull requests, CI), but to provide an additional
read-only distribution channel for the Git data (commits, branches, tags etc.)
because having multiple contribution platforms would introduce excessive
complexity and asynchrony.

Mirrors require little maintenance and should not have a financial impact on
the PSF, since many hosting providers offer free plans which are sufficient for
a mirror.


Specification
=============

The repository will be mirrored using Git's
`--mirror <https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone#Documentation/git-clone.txt---mirror>`__
option, either using a platform's built-in integration [#gldoc]_ or a script.
The repository should be in the platform's equivalent of the GitHub
`python organization <https://github.com/python/>`_.

To avoid confusion, all contribution-related tabs (Issues, Pull Requests,
Discussions, etc.) will be disabled, and the fact that the repository is a
mirror will be clearly noted in the description.


Security Implications
=====================

This PEP increases the security workload, as two platforms must be secured.
Because the mirror is read-only, some risks of compromise are alleviated,
but not all.

Access to the repository should follow the
`principle of least privilege <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege>`_.


Backwards Compatibility
=======================

This PEP has no effect on existing contributor workflows.


Open Questions
==============

What platform should be used? The platform should be free, so as not to have a
financial impact on the PSF. There are several options, for example
`GitLab <https://gitlab.com/>`_ and `Codeberg <https://codeberg.org/>`_.
