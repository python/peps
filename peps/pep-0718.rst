Abstract
--------

This PEP proposes making function objects subscriptable for typing purposes. Doing so
gives developers explicit control over the types produced by the type checker where
bi-directional inference (which allows for the types of parameters of anonymous
functions to be inferred) and other methods than specialisation are insufficient. It
also brings functions in line with regular classes in their ability to be
subscriptable.

Motivation
----------

Unknown Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Currently, it is not possible to infer the type parameters to generic functions in
certain situations:

.. code-block:: python

   def make_list[T](*args: T) -> list[T]: ...
   reveal_type(make_list())  # type checker cannot infer a meaningful type for T

Making instances of ``FunctionType`` subscriptable would allow for this constructor to
be typed:

.. code-block:: python

   reveal_type(make_list[int]())  # type is list[int]

Currently you have to use an assignment to provide a precise type:

.. code-block:: python

   x: list[int] = make_list()
   reveal_type(x)  # type is list[int]

but this code is unnecessarily verbose taking up multiple lines for a simple function
call.

Similarly, ``T`` in this example cannot currently be meaningfully inferred, so ``x`` is
untyped without an extra assignment:

.. code-block:: python

   def factory[T](func: Callable[[T], Any]) -> Foo[T]: ...

   reveal_type(factory(lambda x: "Hello World" * x))

If function objects were subscriptable, however, a more specific type could be given:

.. code-block:: python

   reveal_type(factory[int](lambda x: "Hello World" * x))  # type is Foo[int]

Undecidable Inference
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are even cases where subclass relations make type inference impossible. However,
if you can specialise the function type checkers can infer a meaningful type.

.. code-block:: python

   def foo[T](x: Sequence[T] | T) -> list[T]: ...

   reveal_type(foo[bytes](b"hello"))

Currently, type checkers do not consistently synthesise a type here.

Unsolvable Type Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Currently, with unspecialised literals, it is not possible to determine a type for
situations similar to:

.. code-block:: python

   def foo[T](x: list[T]) -> T: ...
   reveal_type(foo([]))  # type checker cannot infer T (yet again)

.. code-block:: python

   reveal_type(foo[int]([]))  # type is int

It is also useful to be able to specify in cases in which a certain type must be passed
to a function beforehand:

.. code-block:: python

   words = ["hello", "world"]
   foo[int](words)  # Invalid: list[str] is incompatible with list[int]

Allowing subscription makes functions and methods consistent with generic classes where
they weren't already. Whilst all of the proposed changes can be implemented using
callable generic classes, syntactic sugar would be highly welcome.

Due to this, specialising the function and using it as a new factory is fine

.. code-block:: python

   make_int_list = make_list[int]
   reveal_type(make_int_list())  # type is list[int]

Monomorphisation and Reification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This proposal also opens the door to
`monomorphisation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomorphization>`_ and
`reified types <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reification_(computer_science)>`_.

This would allow for a functionality which anecdotally has been requested many times.

*Please note this feature is not being proposed by the PEP, but may be implemented in
the future.*

The syntax for such a feature may look something like:

.. code-block:: python

   def foo[T]():
      return T.__value__

   assert foo[int]() is int

Rationale
---------

Function objects in this PEP is used to refer to ``FunctionType``\ , ``MethodType``\ ,
``BuiltinFunctionType``\ , ``BuiltinMethodType`` and ``MethodWrapperType``\ .

For ``MethodType`` you should be able to write:

.. code-block:: python

   class Foo:
       def make_list[T](self, *args: T) -> list[T]: ...

   Foo().make_list[int]()

and have it work similarly to a ``FunctionType``.

For ``BuiltinFunctionType``, so builtin generic functions (e.g. ``max`` and ``min``)
work like ones defined in Python. Built-in functions should behave as much like
functions implemented in Python as possible.

``BuiltinMethodType`` is the same type as ``BuiltinFunctionType``.

``MethodWrapperType`` (e.g. the type of ``object().__str__``) is useful for
generic magic methods.

Specification
-------------

Function objects should implement ``__getitem__`` to allow for subscription at runtime
and return an instance of ``types.GenericAlias`` with ``__origin__`` set as the
callable and ``__args__`` as the types passed.

Type checkers should support subscripting functions and understand that the parameters
passed to the function subscription should follow the same rules as a generic callable
class.

Setting ``__orig_class__``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Currently, ``__orig_class__`` is an attribute set in ``GenericAlias.__call__`` to the
instance of the ``GenericAlias`` that created the called class e.g.

.. code-block:: python

   class Foo[T]: ...

   assert Foo[int]().__orig_class__ == Foo[int]

Currently, ``__orig_class__`` is unconditionally set; however, to avoid potential
erasure on any created instances, this attribute should not be set if ``__origin__`` is
an instance of any function object.

The following code snippet would fail at runtime without this change as
``__orig_class__`` would be ``bar[str]`` and not ``Foo[int]``.

.. code-block:: python

   def bar[U]():
       return Foo[int]()

   assert bar[str]().__orig_class__  == Foo[int]

Interactions with ``@typing.overload``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Overloaded functions should work much the same as already, since they have no effect on
the runtime type. This change will lead to more expressiveness with user's able to
decide and the behaviour/overload can be specified by the developer rather than leaving
it to ordering of overloads/unions.

.. code-block:: python

   # N.B. `class bytes(Sequence[int]): ...` and `Foo` is a non-specified generic type
   @overload
   def seq_first[T: Sequence[int]](x: T) -> T: ...
   @overload
   def seq_first[T: bytes](x: T) -> Foo[T]: ...

   @overload
   def bytes_first[T: bytes](x: T) -> Foo[T]: ...
   @overload
   def bytes_first[T: Sequence[int]](x: T) -> T: ...

   reveal_type(seq_first(b""))  # type is bytes
   reveal_type(bytes_first(b""))  # type is Foo[bytes]

Explicit specialisation will restrict the set of available overloads

.. code-block:: python

   @overload
   def make[T](x: T) -> T: ...
   @overload
   def make(x: str, y: str) -> tuple[int, int]: ...

   reveal_type(make[int](1))             # type is int
   reveal_type(make[int]("foo", "bar"))  # Invalid: no overload for `make[int](x:str, y: str)` found, a similar overload exists but explicit specialisation prevented its use

Functions Parameterized by ``TypeVarTuple``s
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Currently type checkers disallow the use of multiple ``TypeVarTuple``s in it's generic
parameters, however it is currently valid to have a function as such

.. code-block:: python

   def foo[*T, *U](bar: Bar[*T], baz: Baz[*U]): ...
   def spam[*T](bar: Bar[*T]): ...

This PEP does not allow similar functions to be subscripted, for the same reason as
defined in :pep:`PEP 646<646#multiple-type-variable-tuples-not-allowed>`.

.. code-block:: python

   foo[int, str, bool, complex](Bar(), Baz())  # Invalid: cannot determine which parameters are passed to *T and *U. Explicitly parameterise the instances individually
   spam[int, str, bool, complex](Bar())        # OK


Binding Rules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Subscriptions on methods (including classmethods, staticmethods etc.) should only have
access to their function's type parameters and not the enclosing class's. Subscription
should follow the rules specified in :pep:`PEP 696<696#binding-rules>` methods should
be bound on attribute access.

.. code-block:: python

   class C[T]:
       def method[U](self, x: T, y: U): ...
       @classmethod
       def cls[U](cls, x: T, y: U): ...

   C[int].method[str](0, "")  # OK
   C[int].cls[str](0, "")     # OK
   C.cls[int, str](0, "")     # Invalid: too many type parameters
   C.cls[str](0, "")          # OK, T is ideally bound to int here though this is open for type checkers to decide

Backwards Compatibility
-----------------------
Currently these classes are not subclassable and so there are no backwards
compatibility concerns with regards to classes already implementing
``__getitem__``.
