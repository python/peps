Abstract
========

To analyze Python programs precisely, type checkers need to know when two classes can and cannot have a common child class.
However, the information necessary to determine this is not currently part of the type system. This PEP adds a new
decorator, ``@typing.solid_base``, that indicates that a class is a "solid base". Two classes that have distinct, unrelated
solid bases cannot have a common child class.

Motivation
==========

In type checking Python, an important concept is that of reachability. Python type checkers generally
detect when a branch of code can never be reached, and they warn users about such code. This is useful
because unreachable code unnecessarily complicates the program, and its presence can be an indication of a bug.

For example, in this program::

    def f(x: bool) -> None:
        if isinstance(x, str):
            print("It's both!")

both pyright and mypy (with ``--warn-unreachable``), two popular type checkers, will warn that the body of the
``if`` block is unreachable, because if ``x`` is a ``bool``, it cannot also be a ``str``.

Reachability is complicated in Python by the presence of multiple inheritance. If instead of ``bool`` and ``str``,
we use two user-defined classes, mypy and pyright do not show any warnings::

    class A: pass
    class B: pass

    def f(x: A):
        if isinstance(x, B):
            print("It's both!")

This is correct, because a class that inherits from both ``A`` and ``B`` could exist.

We see a divergence between type checkers in another case, where we use ``int`` and ``str``::

    def f(x: int):
        if isinstance(x, str):
            print("It's both!")

For this code, pyright shows no errors but mypy will claim that the branch is unreachable. Mypy is technically correct
here: CPython does not allow a class to inherit from both ``int`` and ``str``, so the branch is unreachable.
However, the information necessary to determine that these base classes are incompatible is not currently available in
the type system. Mypy, in fact, uses a heuristic based on the presence of incompatible methods; this heuristic works
reasonably well in practice, especially for built-in types, but it is
incorrect in general, as discussed in more detail :ref:`below <pep-800-mypy-incompatibility-check>`.

The experimental ``ty`` type checker uses a third approach that aligns more closely with the :ref:`runtime behavior of Python <pep-800-solid-bases-cpython>`:
it recognizes certain classes as "solid bases" that restrict multiple inheritance. Broadly speaking, every class must
inherit from at most one unique solid base, and if there is no unique solid base, the class cannot exist; we'll provide a more
precise definition below. However, ty's approach relies on hardcoded knowledge of particular built-in types.

This PEP proposes an extension to the type system that makes it possible to express when multiple inheritance is not
allowed at runtime: an ``@solid_base`` decorator that marks classes as "solid bases".
This gives type checkers a more precise understanding of reachability, and helps in several concrete areas.

Invalid class definitions
-------------------------

The following class definition raises an error at runtime, because ``int`` and ``str`` are distinct solid bases::

    class C(int, str): pass

Without knowledge of solid bases, type checkers are not currently able to detect the reason why this class
definition is invalid, though they may detect that if this class were to exist, some of its methods would be incompatible.
(When it sees this class definition, mypy will point at incompatible definitions of ``__add__`` and several other
methods.)

This is not a particularly compelling problem by itself, as the error would usually be caught the first time the code
is imported, but it is mentioned here for completeness.

Reachability
------------

We already mentioned the reachability of code using ``isinstance()``. Similar issues arise with other type
narrowing constructs such as ``match`` statements: correct inference of reachability requires an understanding of
solid bases.

::

    class A: pass
    class B: pass

    def f(x: A):
        match x:
            case B():  # reachable
                print("It's both!")

    def g(x: int):
        match x:
            case str():  # unreachable
                print("It's both!")

Overloads
---------

Functions decorated with ``@overload`` may be unsafe if the parameter types of some overloads overlap, but the return types
do not. For example, the following set of overloads could be exploited to
`achieve unsound behavior <https://github.com/JelleZijlstra/unsoundness/blob/04d16e5ea1a6492d82e8131f72894c9dcad1a55c/examples/overload/undetected_overlap.py>`__::

    from typing import overload

    class A: pass
    class B: pass

    @overload
    def f(x: A) -> str: ...
    @overload
    def f(x: B) -> int: ...

If a class exists that inherits from both ``A`` and ``B``, then type checkers could pick the wrong overload on a
call to ``f()``.

Type checkers could detect this source of unsafety and warn about it, but a correct implementation requires an understanding of solid bases,
because it relies on knowing whether values that are instances of both ``A`` and ``B`` can exist.
Although many type checkers already perform a version of this check for overlapping overloads, the typing specification does not
currently prescribe how this check should work. This PEP does not propose to change that, but it helps provide a building block for
a sound check for overlapping overloads.

Intersection types
------------------

Explicit intersection types, denoting a type that contains values that are instances of all of the
given types, are not currently part of the type system. They do, however, arise naturally in a set-theoretic type system
like Python's as a result of type narrowing, and future extensions to the type system may add support for explicit intersection types.

With intersection types, it is often important to know whether a particular intersection is inhabited, that is, whether
there are values that can be members of that intersection. This allows type checkers to understand reachability and
provide more precise type information to users.

As a concrete example, a possible implementation of assignability with intersection types could be that
given an intersection type ``A & B``, a type ``C`` is assignable to it if ``C`` is assignable to at least one of
``A`` and ``B``, and overlaps with all of ``A`` and ``B``. ("Overlaps" here means that at least one runtime value could exist
that would be a member of both types. That is, ``A`` and ``B`` overlap if ``A & B`` is inhabited.) The second part of the rule ensures that ``str`` is not assignable to a type like ``int & Any``: while ``str`` is assignable to ``Any``,
it does not overlap with ``int``. But of course, we can only know that ``str`` and ``int`` do not overlap if we know
that both classes are solid bases.

Overview
--------

Solid bases can be helpful in many corners of the type system. Though some of these corners are underspecified,
speculative, or of marginal importance, in each case the concept of solid bases enables type checkers to gain a more
precise understanding than the current type system allows. Thus, solid bases provide a firm foundation
(a solid base, if you will) for improving the Python type system.

Rationale
=========

The concept of "solid bases" enables type checkers to understand when a common child class of two classes can and cannot
exist. To communicate this concept to type checkers, we add an ``@solid_base`` decorator to the type system that marks
a class as a solid base. The semantics are roughly that a class cannot have two unrelated solid bases.

Runtime restrictions on multiple inheritance
--------------------------------------------

While Python generally allows multiple inheritance, the runtime imposes various restrictions, as documented in
`CPython PR 136844 <https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/136844/files>`__ (hopefully soon to be merged).
Two sets of restrictions, around a consistent MRO and a consistent metaclass, can already be implemented by
type checkers using information available in the type system. The third restriction, around instance layout,
is the one that requires knowledge of solid bases. Classes that contain a non-empty ``__slots__`` definition
are automatically solid bases, as are many built-in classes implemented in C.

Alternative implementations of Python, such as PyPy, tend to behave similarly to CPython but may differ in details,
such as exactly which standard library classes are solid bases. As the type system does not currently contain any
explicit support for alternative Python implementations, this PEP recommends that stub libraries such as typeshed
use CPython's behavior to determine when to use the ``@solid_base`` decorator. If future extensions to the type system
add support for alternative implementations (for example, branching on the value of :py:data:`sys.implementation.name <sys.implementation>`),
stubs could condition the presence of the ``@solid_base`` decorator on the implementation where necessary.

``@solid_base`` in implementation files
---------------------------------------

The most obvious use case for the ``@solid_base`` decorator will be in stub files for C libraries, such as the standard library,
for marking solid bases implemented in C.

However, there are also use cases for marking solid bases in implementation files, where the effect would be to disallow
the existence of child classes that inherit from the decorated class and another solid base, such as a standard library class
or another user class decorated with ``@solid_base``. For example, this could allow type checkers to flag code that can only
be reachable if a class exists that inherits from both a user class and a standard library class such as ``int`` or ``str``,
which may be technically possible but not practically plausible.

::

    @solid_base
    class BaseModel:
        # ... General logic for model classes
        pass

    class Species(BaseModel):
        name: str
        # ... more fields

    def process_species(species: Species):
        if isinstance(species, str):  # oops, forgot `.name`
            pass  # type checker should warn about this branch being unreachable
            # BaseModel and str are solid bases, so a class that inherits from both cannot exist

This is similar in principle to the existing ``@final`` decorator, which also acts to restrict subclassing: in stubs, it
is used to mark classes that programmatically disallow subclassing, but in implementation files, it is often used to
indicate that a class is not intended to be subclassed, without runtime enforcement.

``@solid_base`` on special classes
----------------------------------

The ``@solid_base`` decorator is primarily intended for nominal classes, but the type system contains some other constructs that
syntactically use class definitions, so we have to consider whether the decorator should be allowed on them as well, and if so,
what it would mean.

For ``Protocol`` definitions, the most consistent interpretation would be that the only classes that can implement the
protocol would be classes that use nominal inheritance from the protocol, or ``@final`` classes that implement the protocol.
Other classes either have or could potentially have a solid base that is not the protocol. This is convoluted and not useful,
so we disallow ``@solid_base`` on ``Protocol`` definitions.

Similarly, the concept of a "solid base" is not meaningful on ``TypedDict`` definitions, as TypedDicts are purely structural types.

Although they receive some special treatment in the type system, ``NamedTuple`` definitions create real nominal classes that can
have child classes, so it makes sense to allow ``@solid_base`` on them and treat them like regular classes for the purposes
of the solid base mechanism. All ``NamedTuple`` classes have ``tuple``, a solid base, in their MRO, so they
cannot double inherit from other solid bases.

Specification
=============

A decorator ``@typing.solid_base`` is added to the type system. It may only be used on nominal classes, including ``NamedTuple``
definitions; it is a type checker error to use the decorator on a function, ``TypedDict`` definition, or ``Protocol`` definition.

We define two properties on (nominal) classes: a class may or may not *be* a solid base, and every class must *have* a valid solid base.

A class is a solid base if it is decorated with ``@typing.solid_base``, or if it contains a non-empty ``__slots__`` definition.
This includes classes that have ``__slots__`` because of the ``@dataclass(slots=True)`` decorator or
because of the use of the ``dataclass_transform`` mechanism to add slots.
The universal base class, ``object``, is also a solid base.

To determine a class's solid base, we look at all of its base classes to determine a set of candidate solid bases. For each base
that is itself a solid base, the candidate is the base itself; otherwise, it is the base's solid base. If the candidate set contains
a single solid base, that is the class's solid base. If there are multiple candidates, but one of them is a subclass of all other candidates,
that class is the solid base. If no such candidate exists, the class does not have a valid solid base, and therefore cannot exist.

Type checkers must check for a valid solid base when checking class definitions, and emit a diagnostic if they encounter a class
definition that lacks a valid solid base. Type checkers may also use the solid base mechanism to determine whether types are disjoint,
for example when checking whether a type narrowing construct like ``isinstance()`` results in an unreachable branch.

Example::

    from typing import solid_base, assert_never

    @solid_base
    class Solid1:
        pass

    @solid_base
    class Solid2:
        pass

    @solid_base
    class SolidChild(Solid1):
        pass

    class C1:  # solid base is `object`
        pass

    # OK: candidate solid bases are `Solid1` and `object`, and `Solid1` is a subclass of `object`.
    class C2(Solid1, C1):  # solid base is `Solid1`
        pass

    # OK: candidate solid bases are `SolidChild` and `Solid1`, and `SolidChild` is a subclass of `Solid1`.
    class C3(SolidChild, Solid1):  # solid base is `SolidChild`
        pass

    # error: candidate solid bases are `Solid1` and `Solid2`, but neither is a subclass of the other
    class C4(Solid1, Solid2):
        pass

    def narrower(obj: Solid1) -> None:
        if isinstance(obj, Solid2):
            assert_never(obj)  # OK: child class of `Solid1` and `Solid2` cannot exist
        if isinstance(obj, C1):
            reveal_type(obj)  # Shows a non-empty type, e.g. `Solid1 & C1`

Runtime implementation
======================

A new decorator, ``@solid_base``, will be added to the ``typing`` module. Its runtime behavior (consistent with
similar decorators like ``@final``) is to set an attribute ``.__solid_base__ = True`` on the decorated object,
then return its argument::

    def solid_base(cls):
        cls.__solid_base__ = True
        return cls

The ``__solid_base__`` attribute may be used for runtime introspection. However, there is no runtime
enforcement of this decorator on user-defined classes.

It will be useful to validate whether the ``@solid_base`` decorator should be applied in a stub. While
CPython does not document precisely which classes are solid bases, it is possible to replicate the behavior
of the interpreter using runtime introspection
(`example implementation <https://github.com/JelleZijlstra/pycroscope/blob/0d19236e4eda771175170a6b165b0e9f6a211d19/pycroscope/relations.py#L1469>`__).
Stub validation tools, such as mypy's ``stubtest``, could use this logic to check whether the
``@solid_base`` decorator is applied to the correct classes in stubs.

Backward compatibility
======================

For compatibility with earlier versions of Python, the ``@solid_base`` decorator will be added to the
``typing_extensions`` backport package.

At runtime, the new decorator poses no compatibility issues.

In stubs, the decorator may be added to solid base classes even if not all type checkers understand the decorator yet;
such type checkers should simply treat the decorator as a no-op.

When type checkers add support for this PEP, users may see some changes in type checking behavior around reachability
and intersections. These changes should be positive, as they will better reflect the runtime behavior, and the scale of
user-visible changes is likely limited, similar to the normal amount of change between type checker versions. Type checkers
that are concerned about the impact of this change could use transition mechanisms such as opt-in flags.

Security Implications
=====================

None known.


How to Teach This
=================

Most users will not have to directly use or understand the ``@solid_base`` decorator, as the expectation is that will be
primarily used in library stubs for low-level libraries. Teachers of Python can introduce
the concept of "solid bases" to explain why multiple inheritance is not allowed in certain cases. Teachers of
Python typing can introduce the decorator when teaching type narrowing constructs like ``isinstance()`` to
explain to users why type checkers treat certain branches as unreachable.

Reference Implementation
========================

None yet.


Appendix
========

This appendix discusses the existing situation around multiple inheritance in the type system and
in the CPython runtime in more detail.

.. _pep-800-solid-bases-cpython:

Solid bases in CPython
----------------------

The concept of "solid bases" has been part of the CPython implementation for a long time;
the concept dates back to `a 2001 commit <https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/6d6c1a35e08b95a83dbe47dbd9e6474daff00354>`__.
Nevertheless, the concept has received little attention in the documentation.
Although details of the mechanism are closely tied to CPython's internal object representation,
it is useful to explain at a high level how and why CPython works this way.

Every object in CPython is essentially a pointer to a C struct, a contiguous piece of memory that
contains information about the object. Some information is managed by the interpreter and shared
by many or all objects, such as a reference to the type of the object, and the attribute ``__dict__``
for user-defined objects. Some classes contain additional information that is specific to that class.
For example, user-defined classes with ``__slots__`` contain a place in memory for each slot,
and the built-in ``float`` class contains a C ``double`` value that stores the value of the float.
This memory layout must be preserved for all instances of the class: C code that
interacts with a ``float`` expects to find the value at a particular offset in the object's memory.

When a child class is created, CPython must create a memory layout for the new class that
is compatible with all of its parent classes. For example, when a child class of ``float``
is created, it must be possible to pass instances of the child class to C code that interacts
directly with the underlying struct for the ``float`` class. Therefore, such a subclass must store
the ``double`` value at the same offset as the parent ``float`` class does. It may, however, add
additional fields at the end of the struct. CPython knows how to do this with the ``__dict__``
attribute, which is why it is possible to create a child class of ``float`` that adds a ``__dict__``.

However, there is no way to combine a ``float``, which must have a ``double`` in its struct,
with another C type like ``int``, which stores different data at the same spot. Therefore,
a common subclass of ``float`` and ``int`` cannot exist. We say that ``float`` and ``int``
are solid bases.

A class implemented in C is a solid base if it has an underlying struct that stores
data at a fixed offset, and that struct is different from the struct of its parent class.
A C class may also store a variable-size array of data (such as the contents of a string);
if this differs from the parent class, the class also becomes a solid base.
CPython's implementation deduces this from the :c:member:`~PyTypeObject.tp_itemsize`
and :c:member:`~PyTypeObject.tp_basicsize` fields of the type object, which are also
accessible from Python code as the undocumented attributes ``__itemsize__`` and ``__basicsize__``
on type objects.

Similarly, classes implemented in Python are solid bases if they have ``__slots__``, because
slots force a particular memory layout.

.. _pep-800-mypy-incompatibility-check:

Mypy's incompatibility check
----------------------------

The mypy type checker considers two classes to be incompatible if they have
incompatible methods. For example, mypy considers the ``int`` and ``str`` classes to be incompatible
because they have incompatible definitions of various methods. Given a class definition like::

    class C(int, str):
        pass

Mypy will output ``Definition of "__add__" in base class "int" is incompatible with definition in base class "str"``,
and similar errors for a number of other methods. These errors are correct, because the definitions of
``__add__`` in the two classes are indeed incompatible: ``int.__add__`` expects an ``int`` argument, while
``str.__add__`` expects a ``str``. If this class were to exist, at runtime ``__add__`` would resolve to
``int.__add__``. Instances of ``C`` would also be members of the ``str`` type, but they would not support
some of the operations that ``str`` supports, such as concatenation with another ``str``.

So far, so good. But mypy also uses very similar logic to conclude that no class
can inherit from both ``int`` and ``str``.
Nevertheless, it accepts the following class definition without error::

    from typing import Never

    class C(int, str):
        def __add__(self, other: object) -> Never:
            raise TypeError
        def __mod__(self, other: object) -> Never:
            raise TypeError
        def __mul__(self, other: object) -> Never:
            raise TypeError
        def __rmul__(self, other: object) -> Never:
            raise TypeError
        def __ge__(self, other: int | str) -> bool:
            return int(self) > other if isinstance(other, int) else str(self) > other
        def __gt__(self, other: int | str) -> bool:
            return int(self) >= other if isinstance(other, int) else str(self) >= other
        def __lt__(self, other: int | str) -> bool:
            return int(self) < other if isinstance(other, int) else str(self) < other
        def __le__(self, other: int | str) -> bool:
            return int(self) <= other if isinstance(other, int) else str(self) <= other
        def __getnewargs__(self) -> Never:
            raise TypeError

There is a similar situation with attributes. Given two classes with incompatible
attributes, mypy claims that a common subclass cannot exist, yet it accepts
a subclass that overrides these attributes to make them compatible::

    from typing import Never

    class X:
        a: int

    class Y:
        a: str

    class Z(X, Y):
        @property
        def a(self) -> Never:
            raise RuntimeError("no luck")
        @a.setter
        def a(self, value: int | str) -> None:
            pass

While the examples given so far rely on overrides that return ``Never``, mypy's rule
can also reject classes that have more practically useful implementations::

    from typing import Literal

    class Carnivore:
        def eat(self, food: Literal["meat"]) -> None:
            print("devouring meat")

    class Herbivore:
        def eat(self, food: Literal["plants"]) -> None:
            print("nibbling on plants")

    class Omnivore(Carnivore, Herbivore):
        def eat(self, food: str) -> None:
            print(f"eating {food}")

    def is_it_both(obj: Carnivore):
        # mypy --warn-unreachable:
        # Subclass of "Carnivore" and "Herbivore" cannot exist: would have incompatible method signatures
        if isinstance(obj, Herbivore):
            pass

Mypy's rule works reasonably well in practice for deducing whether an intersection of two
classes is inhabited. Most builtin classes that are solid bases happen to implement common dunder
methods such as ``__add__`` and ``__iter__`` in incompatible ways, so mypy will consider them
incompatible. There are some exceptions: mypy allows ``class C(BaseException, int): ...``,
though both of these classes are solid bases and the class definition is rejected at runtime.
Conversely, when multiple inheritance is used in practice, usually the parent classes will not
have incompatible methods.

Thus, mypy's approach to deciding that two classes cannot intersect is both too broad
(it incorrectly considers some intersections to be uninhabited) and too narrow (it misses
some intersections that are uninhabited because of solid bases). This is discussed in
`an issue on the mypy tracker <https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/19377>`__.
