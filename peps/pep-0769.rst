PEP: 769
Title: Add a 'default' keyword argument to 'attrgetter' and 'itemgetter'
Author: Facundo Batista <facundo@taniquetil.com.ar>
Status: Draft
Type: Standards Track
Created: 22-Dec-2024

Abstract
========

This proposal aims to enhance the ``operator`` module by adding a
``default`` keyword argument to the ``attrgetter`` and ``itemgetter``
functions. This addition would allow these functions to return a
specified default value when the targeted attribute or item is missing,
thereby preventing exceptions and simplifying code that handles optional
attributes or items.


Motivation
==========

Currently, ``attrgetter`` and ``itemgetter`` raise exceptions if the
specified attribute or item is absent. This limitation requires
developers to implement additional error handling, leading to more
complex and less readable code.

Introducing a ``default`` parameter would streamline operations involving
optional attributes or items, reducing boilerplate code and enhancing
code clarity.


Rationale
=========

The primary design decision is to introduce a single ``default`` parameter
applicable to all specified attributes or items.

This approach maintains simplicity and avoids the complexity of assigning
individual default values to multiple attributes or items. While some
discussions considered allowing multiple defaults, the increased
complexity and potential for confusion led to favoring a single default
value for all cases (more about this below in `Rejected Ideas
<PEP 769 Rejected Ideas_>`__).


Specification
=============

Proposed behaviours:

- **attrgetter**: ``f = attrgetter("name", default=XYZ)`` followed by
  ``f(obj)`` would return ``obj.name`` if the attribute exists, else
  ``XYZ``.

- **itemgetter**: ``f = itemgetter(2, default=XYZ)`` followed by
  ``f(obj)`` would return ``obj[2]`` if that is valid, else ``XYZ``.

This enhancement applies to single and multiple attribute/item
retrievals, with the default value returned for any missing attribute or
item.

No functionality change is incorporated if ``default`` is not used.


Examples for attrgetter
-----------------------

Current behaviour, no changes introduced::

    >>> class C:
    ...   class D:
    ...     class X:
    ...       pass
    ...   class E:
    ...     pass
    ...
    >>> attrgetter("D")(C)
    <class '__main__.C.D'>
    >>> attrgetter("badname")(C)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    AttributeError: type object 'C' has no attribute 'badname'
    >>> attrgetter("D", "E")(C)
    (<class '__main__.C.D'>, <class '__main__.C.E'>)
    >>> attrgetter("D", "badname")(C)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    AttributeError: type object 'C' has no attribute 'badname'
    >>> attrgetter("D.X")(C)
    <class '__main__.C.D.X'>
    >>> attrgetter("D.badname")(C)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    AttributeError: type object 'D' has no attribute 'badname'

Using ``default``::

    >>> attrgetter("D", default="noclass")(C)
    <class '__main__.C.D'>
    >>> attrgetter("badname", default="noclass")(C)
    'noclass'
    >>> attrgetter("D", "E", default="noclass")(C)
    (<class '__main__.C.D'>, <class '__main__.C.E'>)
    >>> attrgetter("D", "badname", default="noclass")(C)
    (<class '__main__.C.D'>, 'noclass')
    >>> attrgetter("D.X", default="noclass")(C)
    <class '__main__.C.D.X'>
    >>> attrgetter("D.badname", default="noclass")(C)
    'noclass'


Examples for itemgetter
-----------------------

Current behaviour, no changes introduced::

    >>> obj = ["foo", "bar", "baz"]
    >>> itemgetter(1)(obj)
    'bar'
    >>> itemgetter(5)(obj)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    IndexError: list index out of range
    >>> itemgetter(1, 0)(obj)
    ('bar', 'foo')
    >>> itemgetter(1, 5)(obj)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    IndexError: list index out of range


Using ``default``::

    >>> itemgetter(1, default="XYZ")(obj)
    'bar'
    >>> itemgetter(5, default="XYZ")(obj)
    'XYZ'
    >>> itemgetter(1, 0, default="XYZ")(obj)
    ('bar', 'foo')
    >>> itemgetter(1, 5, default="XYZ")(obj)
    ('bar', 'XYZ')


.. _PEP 769 About Possible Implementations:

About Possible Implementations
------------------------------

For the case of ``attrgetter`` is quite direct: it implies using
``getattr`` catching a possible ``AttributeError``. So
``attrgetter("name", default=XYZ)(obj)`` would be like::

    try:
        value = getattr(obj, "name")
    except (TypeError, IndexError, KeyError):
        value = XYZ

Note we cannot rely on using ``gettattr`` with a default value, as would
be impossible to distinguish what it returned on each step when an
attribute chain is specified (e.g.
``attrgetter("foo.bar.baz", default=XYZ)``).

For the case of ``itemgetter`` it's not that easy. The more
straightforward way is similar to above, also simple to define and
understand: attempting ``__getitem__`` and catching a possible exception
(any of the three indicated in ``__getitem__`` reference). This way,
``itemgetter(123, default=XYZ)(obj)`` would be equivalent to::

    try:
        value = obj[123]
    except (TypeError, IndexError, KeyError):
        value = XYZ

However, this would be not as efficient as we'd want for particular cases,
e.g. using dictionaries where particularly good performance is desired. A
more complex alternative would be::

    if isinstance(obj, dict):
        value = obj.get(123, XYZ)
    else:
        try:
            value = obj[123]
        except (TypeError, IndexError, KeyError):
            value = XYZ

Better performance, more complicated to implement and explain. This is
the first case in the `Open Issues <PEP 769 Open Issues_>`__ section later.


Corner Cases
------------

Providing a ``default`` option would only work when accessing to the
item/attribute would fail in a regular situation. In other words, the
object accessed should not handle defaults theirselves.

For example, the following would be redundant/confusing because
``defaultdict`` will never error out when accessing the item::

    >>> from collections import defaultdict
    >>> from operator import itemgetter
    >>> dd = defaultdict(int)
    >>> itemgetter("foo", default=-1)(dd)
    0

The same applies to any user built object that overloads ``__getitem__``
or ``__getattr__`` implementing fallbacks.


.. _PEP 769 Rejected Ideas:

Rejected Ideas
==============

Multiple Default Values
-----------------------

The idea of allowing multiple default values for multiple attributes or
items was considered.

Two alternatives were discussed, using an iterable that must have the
same quantity of items than parameters given to
``attrgetter``/``itemgetter``, or using a dictionary with keys matching
those names passed to ``attrgetter``/``itemgetter``.

The really complex thing to solve in these casse, that would make the
feature hard to explain and with confusing corners, is what would happen
if an iterable or dictionary is the *unique* default desired for all
items. For example::

    >>> itemgetter("a", default=(1, 2)({})
    (1, 2)
    >>> itemgetter("a", "b", default=(1, 2))({})
    ((1, 2), (1, 2))

If we allow "multiple default values" using ``default``, the first case
in the example above would raise an exception because more items in the
default than names, and the second case would return ``(1, 2))``. This is
why emerged the possibility of using a different name for multiple
defaults (``defaults``, which is expressive but maybe error prone because
too similar to ``default``).

As part of this conversation there was another proposal that would enable
multiple defaults, which is allowing combinations of ``attrgetter`` and
``itemgetter``, e.g.::

    >>> ig_a = itemgetter("a", default=1)
    >>> ig_b = itemgetter("b", default=2)
    >>> ig_combined = itemgetter(ig_a, ig_b)
    >>> ig_combined({"a": 999})
    (999, 2)
    >>> ig_combined({})
    (1, 2)

However, combining ``itemgetter`` or ``attrgetter`` is a totally new
behaviour very complex to define, not impossible, but beyond the scope of
this PEP.

At the end having multiple default values was deemed overly complex and
potentially confusing, and a single ``default`` parameter was favored for
simplicity and predictability.


Tuple Return Consistency
------------------------

Another rejected proposal was adding a flag to always return tuple
regardless of how many keys/names/indices were sourced to arguments.
E.g.::

    >>> letters = ["a", "b", "c"]
    >>> itemgetter(1, return_tuple=True)(letters)
    ('b',)
    >>> itemgetter(1, 2, return_tuple=True)(letters)
    ('b', 'c')

This would be of a little help for multiple default values consistency,
but requires further discussion and for sure is out of the scope of this
PEP.


.. _PEP 769 Open Issues:

Open Issues
===========

Behaviour Equivalence for ``itemgetter``
----------------------------------------

We need to define how ``itemgetter`` would behave, if just attempt to
access the item and capture exceptions no matter which the object, or
validate first if the object provides a ``get`` method and use it to
retrieve the item with a default. See examples in the `About Possible
Implementations <PEP 769 About Possible Implementations_>`__ subsection
above.

This would help performance for the case of dictionaries, but would make
the ``default`` feature somewhat more difficult to explain, and a little
confusing if some object that is not a dictionary but provides a ``get``
method is used. Alternatively, we could call ``.get`` *only* if the
object is an instance of ``dict``.

In any case, a desirable situation is that we do *not* affect performance
at all if the ``default`` is not triggered. Checking for ``.get`` would
get the default faster in case of dicts, but implies doing a verification
in all cases. Using the try/except model would make it not as fast as it
could in the case of dictionaries, but would not introduce delays if the
default is not triggered.


Add a Default to ``getitem``
----------------------------

It was proposed that we could also enhance ``getitem``, as part of the of
this PEP, adding ``default`` also to it.

This will not only improve ``getitem`` itself, but we would also gain
internal consistency in the ``operator`` module and in comparison with
the ``getattr`` builtin function that also has a default.

The definition could be as simple as the try/except proposed above, so
doing ``getitem(obj, name, default)`` would be equivalent to::

    try:
        result = obj[name]
    except (TypeError, IndexError, KeyError):
        result = default

(However see previous open issue about special case for dictionaries)


How to Teach This
=================

As the basic behaviour is not modified, this new ``default`` can be
avoided when teaching ``attrgetter`` and ``itemgetter`` for the first
time, and can be introduced only when the functionality need arises.


Backwards Compatibility
=======================

The proposed changes are backward-compatible. The ``default`` parameter
is optional; existing code without this parameter will function as
before. Only code that explicitly uses the new ``default`` parameter will
exhibit the new behavior, ensuring no disruption to current
implementations.


Security Implications
=====================

Introducing a ``default`` parameter does not inherently introduce
security vulnerabilities.
