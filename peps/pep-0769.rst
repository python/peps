Abstract
========

This proposal aims to enhance the :mod:`operator` module by adding a
``default`` keyword argument to the ``attrgetter``, ``itemgetter`` and
``getitem`` functions. This addition would allow these functions to return a
specified default value when the targeted attribute or item is missing,
thereby preventing exceptions and simplifying code that handles optional
attributes or items.


Motivation
==========

Currently, ``attrgetter`` and ``itemgetter`` raise exceptions if the
specified attribute or item is absent. This limitation requires
developers to implement additional error handling, leading to more
complex and less readable code.

Introducing a ``default`` parameter would streamline operations involving
optional attributes or items, reducing boilerplate code and enhancing
code clarity.

A similar situation occurs with ``getitem``, with the added nuance that
allowing the specification of a default value in this case would resolve
a longstanding asymmetry with the :func:`getattr` built-in function.


Rationale
=========

The primary design decision is to introduce a single ``default`` parameter
applicable to all specified attributes or items.

This approach maintains simplicity and avoids the complexity of assigning
individual default values to multiple attributes or items. While some
discussions considered allowing multiple defaults, the increased
complexity and potential for confusion led to favoring a single default
value for all cases (more about this below in `Rejected Ideas
<PEP 769 Rejected Ideas_>`__).


Specification
=============

Proposed behaviors:

- **attrgetter**: ``f = attrgetter("name", default=XYZ)`` followed by
  ``f(obj)`` would return ``obj.name`` if the attribute exists, else
  ``XYZ``.

- **itemgetter**: ``f = itemgetter(2, default=XYZ)`` followed by
  ``f(obj)`` would return ``obj[2]`` if that is valid, else ``XYZ``.

- **getitem**: ``getitem(obj, k, XYZ)`` or
  ``getitem(obj, k, default=XYZ)`` would return ``obj[k]`` if that is valid,
  else ``XYZ``.

In the first two cases, the enhancement applies to single and multiple
attribute/item retrievals, with the default value returned for any
missing attribute or item.

No functionality change is incorporated in any case if the extra
default (keyword) argument is not used.


Examples for attrgetter
-----------------------

The current behavior is unchanged::

    >>> class C:
    ...   class D:
    ...     class X:
    ...       pass
    ...   class E:
    ...     pass
    ...
    >>> attrgetter("D")(C)
    <class '__main__.C.D'>
    >>> attrgetter("badname")(C)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    AttributeError: type object 'C' has no attribute 'badname'
    >>> attrgetter("D", "E")(C)
    (<class '__main__.C.D'>, <class '__main__.C.E'>)
    >>> attrgetter("D", "badname")(C)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    AttributeError: type object 'C' has no attribute 'badname'
    >>> attrgetter("D.X")(C)
    <class '__main__.C.D.X'>
    >>> attrgetter("D.badname")(C)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    AttributeError: type object 'D' has no attribute 'badname'

With this PEP, using the proposed ``default`` keyword::

    >>> attrgetter("D", default="noclass")(C)
    <class '__main__.C.D'>
    >>> attrgetter("badname", default="noclass")(C)
    'noclass'
    >>> attrgetter("D", "E", default="noclass")(C)
    (<class '__main__.C.D'>, <class '__main__.C.E'>)
    >>> attrgetter("D", "badname", default="noclass")(C)
    (<class '__main__.C.D'>, 'noclass')
    >>> attrgetter("D.X", default="noclass")(C)
    <class '__main__.C.D.X'>
    >>> attrgetter("D.badname", default="noclass")(C)
    'noclass'


Examples for itemgetter
-----------------------

The current behavior is unchanged::

    >>> obj = ["foo", "bar", "baz"]
    >>> itemgetter(1)(obj)
    'bar'
    >>> itemgetter(5)(obj)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    IndexError: list index out of range
    >>> itemgetter(1, 0)(obj)
    ('bar', 'foo')
    >>> itemgetter(1, 5)(obj)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    IndexError: list index out of range


With this PEP, using the proposed ``default`` keyword::

    >>> itemgetter(1, default="XYZ")(obj)
    'bar'
    >>> itemgetter(5, default="XYZ")(obj)
    'XYZ'
    >>> itemgetter(1, 0, default="XYZ")(obj)
    ('bar', 'foo')
    >>> itemgetter(1, 5, default="XYZ")(obj)
    ('bar', 'XYZ')


Examples for getitem
--------------------

The current behavior is unchanged::

    >>> obj = ["foo", "bar", "baz"]
    >>> getitem(obj, 1)
    'bar'
    >>> getitem(obj, 5)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    IndexError: list index out of range


With this PEP, using the proposed extra default, positionally or with
a keyword::

    >>> getitem(obj, 1, "XYZ")
    'bar'
    >>> getitem(obj, 5, "XYZ")
    'XYZ'
    >>> getitem(obj, 1, default="XYZ")
    'bar'
    >>> getitem(obj, 5, default="XYZ")
    'XYZ'


About Possible Implementations
------------------------------

The implementation of ``attrgetter`` is quite direct: it implies using
``getattr`` and catching a possible ``AttributeError``. So
``attrgetter("name", default=XYZ)(obj)`` would be like::

    try:
        value = getattr(obj, "name")
    except AttributeError:
        value = XYZ

Note we cannot rely on using ``getattr`` with a default value, as it would
be impossible to distinguish what it returned on each step when an
attribute chain is specified (e.g.
``attrgetter("foo.bar.baz", default=XYZ)``).

The implementation for ``itemgetter`` and ``getitem`` is not that
easy. The more straightforward way is also simple to define and
understand: attempting ``__getitem__`` and catching a possible
exception (see below). This way, ``itemgetter(123, default=XYZ)(obj)``
or ``getitem(obj, 123, default=XYZ)`` would be equivalent to::

    try:
        value = obj[123]
    except (IndexError, KeyError):
        value = XYZ

However, for performance reasons the implementation may look more
like the following, which has the same exact behavior::

    if type(obj) == dict:
        value = obj.get(123, XYZ)
    else:
        try:
            value = obj[123]
        except (IndexError, KeyError):
            value = XYZ

Note how the verification is about the exact type and not using
``isinstance``; this is to ensure the exact behavior, which would be
impossible if the object is a user defined one that inherits ``dict``
but overwrites ``get`` (similar reason to not check if the object has
a ``get`` method).

This way, performance is better but it's just an implementation detail,
so we can keep the original explanation on how it behaves.

Regarding the exception to be captured, even if ``__getitem__``
can raise ``IndexError``, ``KeyError``, or ``TypeError`` (see its
`reference`_), only the first two can happen if the container does not
contain the indicated key or index, and the latter is likely to signal
a bug in the code, so we're not capturing it to trigger the default
behavior.


Corner Cases
------------

Providing a ``default`` option would only work if accessing the
item/attribute would fail in the normal case. In other words, the
object accessed should not handle defaults itself.

For example, the following would be redundant/confusing because
``defaultdict`` will never error out when accessing the item::

    >>> from collections import defaultdict
    >>> from operator import itemgetter
    >>> dd = defaultdict(int)
    >>> itemgetter("foo", default=-1)(dd)
    0

The same applies to any user defined object that overloads ``__getitem__``
or ``__getattr__`` implementing its own fallbacks.


.. _PEP 769 Rejected Ideas:

Rejected Ideas
==============

Multiple Default Values
-----------------------

The idea of allowing multiple default values for multiple attributes or
items was considered.

Two alternatives were discussed, using an iterable that must have the
same quantity of items as parameters given to
``attrgetter``/``itemgetter``, or using a dictionary with keys matching
those names passed to ``attrgetter``/``itemgetter``.

The really complex thing to solve here (making the
feature hard to explain and with confusing corner cases), is what would happen
if an iterable or dictionary is the *actual* default desired for all
items. For example::

    >>> itemgetter("a", default=(1, 2))({})
    (1, 2)
    >>> itemgetter("a", "b", default=(1, 2))({})
    ((1, 2), (1, 2))

If we allow "multiple default values" using ``default``, the first case
in the example above would raise an exception because there are more items
than names in the default, and the second case would return ``(1, 2))``. This is
why we considered the possibility of using a different name for multiple
defaults (e.g. ``defaults``, which is expressive but maybe error prone because
it is too similar to ``default``).

Another proposal that would enable multiple defaults, is allowing
combinations of ``attrgetter`` and ``itemgetter``, e.g.::

    >>> ig_a = itemgetter("a", default=1)
    >>> ig_b = itemgetter("b", default=2)
    >>> ig_combined = itemgetter(ig_a, ig_b)
    >>> ig_combined({"a": 999})
    (999, 2)
    >>> ig_combined({})
    (1, 2)

However, combining ``itemgetter`` or ``attrgetter`` is totally new
behavior and very complex to define.  While not impossible, it is beyond
the scope of this PEP.

In the end, having multiple default values was deemed overly complex and
potentially confusing, and a single ``default`` parameter was favored for
simplicity and predictability.


Tuple Return Consistency
------------------------

Another rejected proposal was adding a flag to always return a tuple
regardless of how many keys/names/indices were given.
E.g.::

    >>> letters = ["a", "b", "c"]
    >>> itemgetter(1, return_tuple=True)(letters)
    ('b',)
    >>> itemgetter(1, 2, return_tuple=True)(letters)
    ('b', 'c')

This would be of little help for multiple default values consistency,
requiring further discussion, and is out of the scope of this
PEP.


.. _PEP 769 Open Issues:

Open Issues
===========

There are no open issues at this time.


How to Teach This
=================

As the basic behavior is not modified, this new ``default`` can be
avoided when teaching ``attrgetter`` and ``itemgetter`` for the first
time. It can be introduced only when the functionality is needed.


Backwards Compatibility
=======================

The proposed changes are backward-compatible. The ``default`` parameter
is optional; existing code without this parameter will function as
before. Only code that explicitly uses the new ``default`` parameter will
exhibit the new behavior, ensuring no disruption to current
implementations.


Security Implications
=====================

Introducing a ``default`` parameter does not inherently introduce
security vulnerabilities.
