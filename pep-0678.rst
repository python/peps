Abstract
========
Exception objects are typically initialized with a message that describes the
error which has occurred.  Because further information may be available when the
exception is caught and re-raised, this PEP proposes to add a ``.__note__``
attribute and update the builtin traceback formatting code to include it in
the formatted traceback following the exception string.

This is particularly useful in relation to :pep:`654` ``ExceptionGroup`` s, which
make previous workarounds ineffective or confusing.  Use cases have been identified
in the standard library, Hypothesis package, and common code patterns with retries.


Motivation
==========
When an exception is created in order to be raised, it is usually initialized
with information that describes the error that has occurred. There are cases
where it is useful to add information after the exception was caught.
For example,

- testing libraries may wish to show the values involved in a failing assertion,
  or the steps to reproduce a failure (e.g. ``pytest`` and ``hypothesis`` ; example below).
- code with retries may wish to note which iteration or timestamp raised which
  error - especially if re-raising them in an ``ExceptionGroup``
- programming environments for novices can provide more detailed descriptions
  of various errors, and tips for resolving them (e.g. ``friendly-traceback`` ).

Existing approaches must pass this additional information around while keeping
it in sync with the state of raised, and potentially caught or chained, exceptions.
This is already error-prone, and made more difficult by :pep:`654` ``ExceptionGroup`` s,
so the time is right for a built-in solution.  We therefore propose to add a mutable
field ``__note__`` to ``BaseException`` , which can be assigned a string - and
if assigned, is automatically displayed in formatted tracebacks.


Example usage
-------------

   >>> try:
   ...     raise TypeError('bad type')
   ... except Exception as e:
   ...     e.__note__ = 'Add some information'
   ...     raise
   ...
   Traceback (most recent call last):
     File "<stdin>", line 2, in <module>
   TypeError: bad type
   Add some information
   >>>

When collecting exceptions into an exception group, we may want
to add context information for the individual errors. In the following
example with `Hypothesis' proposed support for ExceptionGroup
<https://github.com/HypothesisWorks/hypothesis/pull/3191>`__, each
exception includes a note of the minimal failing example::

    from hypothesis import given, strategies as st, target

    @given(st.integers())
    def test(x):
        assert x < 0
        assert x > 0


    + Exception Group Traceback (most recent call last):
    |   File "test.py", line 4, in test
    |     def test(x):
    |
    |   File "hypothesis/core.py", line 1202, in wrapped_test
    |     raise the_error_hypothesis_found
    |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    | ExceptionGroup: Hypothesis found 2 distinct failures.
    +-+---------------- 1 ----------------
        | Traceback (most recent call last):
        |   File "test.py", line 6, in test
        |     assert x > 0
        |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^
        | AssertionError: assert -1 > 0
        |
        | Falsifying example: test(
        |     x=-1,
        | )
        +---------------- 2 ----------------
        | Traceback (most recent call last):
        |   File "test.py", line 5, in test
        |     assert x < 0
        |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^
        | AssertionError: assert 0 < 0
        |
        | Falsifying example: test(
        |     x=0,
        | )
        +------------------------------------


Specification
=============

``BaseException`` gains a new mutable attribute ``__note__`` , which defaults to
``None`` and may have a string assigned.  When an exception with a note is displayed,
the note is displayed immediately after the exception.

Assigning a new string value overrides an existing note; if concatenation is desired
users are responsible for implementing it with e.g.::

    e.__note__ = msg if e.__note__ is None else e.__note__ + "\n" + msg

It is an error to assign a non-string-or-``None`` value to ``__note__`` ,
or to attempt to delete the attribute.

``BaseExceptionGroup.subgroup`` and ``BaseExceptionGroup.split``
copy the ``__note__`` of the original exception group to the parts.


Backwards Compatibility
=======================

System-defined or "dunder" names (following the pattern ``__*__`` ) are part of the
language specification, with unassigned names reserved for future use and subject
to breakage without warning [1]_.

We are also unaware of any code which *would* be broken by adding ``__note__`` ;
assigning to a ``.__note__`` attribute already *works* on current versions of
Python - the note just won't be displayed with the traceback and exception message.



How to Teach This
=================

The ``__note__`` attribute will be documented as part of the language standard,
and explained as part of the tutorial "Errors and Exceptions" [2]_.



Reference Implementation
========================

``BaseException.__note__`` was implemented in [3]_ and released in CPython 3.11.0a3,
following discussions related to :pep:`654`. [4]_ [5]_ [6]_



Rejected Ideas
==============

Use ``print()`` (or ``logging`` , etc.)
---------------------------------------
Reporting explanatory or contextual information about an error by printing or logging
has historically been an acceptable workaround.  However, we dislike the way this
separates the content from the exception object it refers to - which can lead to
"orphan" reports if the error was caught and handled later, or merely significant
difficulties working out which explanation corresponds to which error.
The new ``ExceptionGroup`` type intensifies these existing challenges.

Keeping the ``__note__`` attached to the exception object, like the traceback,
eliminates these problems.


``raise Wrapper(explanation) from err``
---------------------------------------
An alternative pattern is to use exception chaining: by raising a 'wrapper' exception
containing the context or explanation ``from`` the current exception, we avoid the
separation challenges from ``print()`` .  However, this has two key problems.

First, it changes the type of the exception, which is often a breaking change for
downstream code.  We consider *always* raising a ``Wrapper`` exception unacceptably
inelegant; but because custom exception types might have any number of required
arguments we can't always create an instance of the *same* type with our explanation.
In cases where the exact exception type is known this can work, such as the standard
library ``http.client`` code [7]_, but not for libraries which call user code.

Second, exception chaining reports several lines of additional detail, which are
distracting for experienced users and can be very confusing for beginners.
For example, six of the eleven lines reported for this simple example relate to
exception chaining, and are unnecessary with ``BaseException.__note__`` :

.. code-block:: python

    class Explanation(Exception):
        def __str__(self):
            return "\n" + str(self)

    try:
        raise AssertionError("Failed!")
    except Exception as e:
        raise Explanation("You can reproduce this error by ...") from e

.. code-block::

    $ python example.py
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "example.py", line 6, in <module>
        raise AssertionError(why)
    AssertionError: Failed!
                                                                            # These lines are
    The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:    # confusing for new
                                                                            # users, and they
    Traceback (most recent call last):                                      # only exist due
    File "example.py", line 8, in <module>                                  # to implementation
        raise Explanation(msg) from e                                       # constraints :-(
    Explanation:                                                            # Hence this PEP!
    You can reproduce this error by ...


Subclass Exception and add ``__note__`` downstream
--------------------------------------------------
Traceback printing is built into the C code, and reimplemented in pure Python in
traceback.py. To get ``err.__note__`` printed from a downstream implementation
would *also* require writing custom traceback-printing code; while this could
be shared between projects and reuse some pieces of traceback.py we prefer to
implement this once, upstream.

Custom exception types could implement their ``__str__`` method to include our
proposed ``__note__`` semantics, but this would be rarely and inconsistently
applicable.


Store notes in ``ExceptionGroup`` s
-----------------------------------
Initial discussions proposed making a more focussed change by thinking about how to
associate messages with the nested exceptions in ``ExceptionGroup`` s, such as a list
of notes or mapping of exceptions to notes.  However, this would force a remarkably
awkward API and retains a lesser form of the cross-referencing problem discussed
under "use ``print()`` " above; if this PEP is rejected we prefer the status quo.
Finally, of course, ``__note__`` is not only useful with ``ExceptionGroup`` s!
