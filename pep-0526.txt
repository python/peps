Abstract
========

PEP 484 introduced type hints and; In particular, it introduced the notion of
type comments::

  # a is specified to be a list of ints.
  a = []  # type: List[int]
  # b is a string
  b = None  # type: str
  class Cls:
    my_class_attr = True  # type: bool

This PEP aims at adding syntax to Python for annotating the types of variables and
attributes, instead of expressing them through comments::

  a: List[int] = []
  b: str
  class Cls:
    my_class_attr: ClassAttr[bool] = True

Rationale
=========

Although type comments work well, the fact that they're expressed through
comments has some downsides:

- Text editors often highlight comments differently from type annotations.
- There isn't a way to annotate the type of an undefined variable; you need to
  initialize it to ``None`` (e.g. ``a = None # type: int``).
- Variables annotated in a conditional branch are difficult to read::

    if some_value:
        my_var = function() # type: Logger
    else:
        my_var = another_function() # Why isn't there a type here?

- Since type comments aren't actually part of the language, if a Python script
  wants to parse them, it would require a custom parser instead of just using
  ``ast``.
- It's impossible to retrieve the annotations at runtime outside of attempting to
  find the module's source code and parse it at runtime, which is inelegant, to
  say the least.

The majority of these issues can be alleviated by making the syntax a core part of
the language.

Specification
=============

*** big key concepts, not quite sure what the best way to organize this would be,
or if they deserve their own sections ***

Normal Variable Typing
**********************

The types of locals and globals can be annotated as follows::

  some_number: int           # variable without default
  some_list: List[int] = []  # variable with default

Being able to omit the initial value allows for easier typing of variables
assigned in conditional branches::

  sane_world: bool
  if 2+2 == 4:
      sane_world = True
  else:
      sane_world = False

Note that, although this syntax does allow tuple packing, it does *not* allow one
to annotate the types of variables when tuple unpacking is used::

  # Tuple packing with variable annotation syntax
  t: Any = (1, 2, 3)

  # Tuple unpacking with type comments
  x, y, z = t  # type: int, int, int

  # Tuple unpacking with variable annotation syntax
  x: int
  y: int
  z: int
  x, y, z = t

Omitting a default value leaves the variable uninitialized::

  a: int
  print(a)  # raises NameError

However, annotating a local variable will cause the interpreter to always make
it a local::

  def f():
      a: int
      print(a)  # raises UnboundLocalError
      # Commenting out the `a: int` makes it a NameError!

as if the code were::

  def f():
      if False: a = 0
      print(a)  # raises UnboundLocalError


Class Variable Typing
*********************

Adding variable types allow for us annotate the types of instance variables in class
bodies. In particular, the value-less notation (`a: int`) allows us to annotate
instance variables that should be initialized in `__init__` or `__new__`. The
proposed syntax looks as follows::

  class Starship:
      captain: str                      # instance variable without default
      damage: int = 0                   # instance variable with default
      stats: class Dict[str, int] = {}  # class variable with initialization


Duplicate annotations
*********************

Any duplicate type annotations will be ignored::

  a: int
  a: int  # Doesn't do anything.

The Python compiler will not validate the type expression, and leave it to 
the type checker to complain. The above code will be allowed by the 
compiler at runtime.

Where annotations aren't allowed
********************************

It's illegal to attempt to annotate ``global`` and ``nonlocal``::

  def f():
      global x: int  # SyntaxError

The reason is that ``global`` and ``nonlocal`` don't own variables;
therefore, the type annotations belong in the scope owning the variable.

In addition, you cannot annotate variable used in a ``for`` or ``with``
statement; they must be annotated ahead of time, in a similar manner to tuple
unpacking::

  a: int
  for a in my_iter:
    f: MyFile
    with myfunc() as f:
      # ...

Capturing Types at Runtime
**************************

In order to capture variable types that are usable at runtime, we store the
types in `__annotations__` as dictionaries at various levels. At each level (for
example, global), the types dictionary would be stored in the `__annotations__`
dictionary for that given level. Here is an example for both global and class
level types::

  # print global type annotations
  players: Dict[str, Player]
  print(__annotations__)

  # print class type annotations
  class Starship:
    hitpoints: class int = 50
    stats: class Dict[str, int] = {}
    shield: int = 100
    captain: str  # no initial value
  print(Starship.__annotations__)

A note about locals -- the value of having annotations available locally does not
offset the cost of having to create and populate the annotations dictionary on
every function call.

These annotations would be printed out from the previous program as follows::

  {'players': Dict[str, Player]}

  {'hitpoints': ClassVar[int],
   'stats': ClassVar[Dict[str, int]],
   'shield': int,
   'captain': str
  }

Mypy supports allowing `# type` on assignments to instance variables and other things.
In case you prefer annotating instance variables in `__init__` or `__new__`, you can 
also annotate variable types for instance variables in methods. Despite this, 
`__annotations__` will not be updated for that class.
