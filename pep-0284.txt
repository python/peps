Abstract
========

This PEP proposes to simplify iteration over intervals of
integers, by extending the range of expressions allowed after a
"for" keyword to allow three-way comparisons such as ::

   for lower <= var < upper:

in place of the current ::

   for item in list:

syntax.  The resulting loop or list iteration will loop over all
values of var that make the comparison true, starting from the
left endpoint of the given interval.


Pronouncement
=============

This PEP is rejected.  There were a number of fixable issues with
the proposal (see the fixups listed in Raymond Hettinger's
python-dev post on 18 June 2005 [1]_).  However, even with the fixups the
proposal did not garner support.  Specifically, Guido did not buy
the premise that the ``range()`` format needed fixing, "The whole point
(15 years ago) of ``range()`` was to *avoid* needing syntax to specify a
loop over numbers. I think it's worked out well and there's nothing
that needs to be fixed (except ``range()`` needs to become an iterator,
which it will in Python 3.0)."


Rationale
=========

One of the most common uses of for-loops in Python is to iterate
over an interval of integers.  Python provides functions ``range()``
and ``xrange()`` to generate lists and iterators for such intervals,
which work best for the most frequent case: half-open intervals
increasing from zero.  However, the ``range()`` syntax is more awkward
for open or closed intervals, and lacks symmetry when reversing
the order of iteration.  In addition, the call to an unfamiliar
function makes it difficult for newcomers to Python to understand
code that uses ``range()`` or ``xrange()``.

The perceived lack of a natural, intuitive integer iteration
syntax has led to heated debate on python-list, and spawned at
least four PEPs before this one.  :pep:`204` (rejected) proposed
to re-use Python's slice syntax for integer ranges, leading to a
terser syntax but not solving the readability problem of
multi-argument ``range()``.  :pep:`212` (deferred) proposed several
syntaxes for directly converting a list to a sequence of integer
indices, in place of the current idiom ::

   range(len(list))

for such conversion, and :pep:`281` proposes to simplify the same
idiom by allowing it to be written as ::

   range(list).

:pep:`276` proposes to allow automatic conversion of integers to
iterators, simplifying the most common half-open case but not
addressing the complexities of other types of interval.
Additional alternatives have been discussed on python-list.

The solution described here is to allow a three-way comparison
after a "for" keyword, both in the context of a for-loop and of a
list comprehension::

    for lower <= var < upper:

This would cause iteration over an interval of consecutive
integers, beginning at the left bound in the comparison and ending
at the right bound.  The exact comparison operations used would
determine whether the interval is open or closed at either end and
whether the integers are considered in ascending or descending
order.

This syntax closely matches standard mathematical notation, so is
likely to be more familiar to Python novices than the current
``range()`` syntax.  Open and closed interval endpoints are equally
easy to express, and the reversal of an integer interval can be
formed simply by swapping the two endpoints and reversing the
comparisons.  In addition, the semantics of such a loop would
closely resemble one way of interpreting the existing Python
for-loops::

    for item in list

iterates over exactly those values of item that cause the
expression ::

   item in list

to be true.  Similarly, the new format ::

   for lower <= var < upper:

would iterate over exactly those integer values of var that cause
the expression ::

   lower <= var < upper

to be true.


Specification
=============

We propose to extend the syntax of a for statement, currently ::

   for_stmt: "for" target_list "in" expression_list ":" suite
         ["else" ":" suite]

as described below::

    for_stmt: "for" for_test ":" suite ["else" ":" suite]
    for_test: target_list "in" expression_list |
            or_expr less_comp or_expr less_comp or_expr |
            or_expr greater_comp or_expr greater_comp or_expr
    less_comp: "<" | "<="
    greater_comp: ">" | ">="

Similarly, we propose to extend the syntax of list comprehensions,
currently ::

   list_for: "for" expression_list "in" testlist [list_iter]

by replacing it with::

    list_for: "for" for_test [list_iter]

In all cases the expression formed by for_test would be subject to
the same precedence rules as comparisons in expressions.  The two
comp_operators in a for_test must be required to be both of
similar types, unlike chained comparisons in expressions which do
not have such a restriction.

We refer to the two or_expr's occurring on the left and right
sides of the for-loop syntax as the bounds of the loop, and the
middle or_expr as the variable of the loop.  When a for-loop using
the new syntax is executed, the expressions for both bounds will
be evaluated, and an iterator object created that iterates through
all integers between the two bounds according to the comparison
operations used.  The iterator will begin with an integer equal or
near to the left bound, and then step through the remaining
integers with a step size of +1 or -1 if the comparison operation
is in the set described by less_comp or greater_comp respectively.
The execution will then proceed as if the expression had been ::

   for variable in iterator

where "variable" refers to the variable of the loop and "iterator"
refers to the iterator created for the given integer interval.

The values taken by the loop variable in an integer for-loop may
be either plain integers or long integers, according to the
magnitude of the bounds.  Both bounds of an integer for-loop must
evaluate to a real numeric type (integer, long, or float).  Any
other value will cause the for-loop statement to raise a ``TypeError``
exception.


Issues
======

The following issues were raised in discussion of this and related
proposals on the Python list.

- Should the right bound be evaluated once, or every time through
  the loop?  Clearly, it only makes sense to evaluate the left
  bound once.  For reasons of consistency and efficiency, we have
  chosen the same convention for the right bound.

- Although the new syntax considerably simplifies integer
  for-loops, list comprehensions using the new syntax are not as
  simple.  We feel that this is appropriate since for-loops are
  more frequent than comprehensions.

- The proposal does not allow access to integer iterator objects
  such as would be created by ``xrange``.  True, but we see this as a
  shortcoming in the general list-comprehension syntax, beyond the
  scope of this proposal.  In addition, ``xrange()`` will still be
  available.

- The proposal does not allow increments other than 1 and -1.
  More general arithmetic progressions would need to be created by
  ``range()`` or ``xrange()``, or by a list comprehension syntax such as ::

   [2*x for 0 <= x <= 100]

- The position of the loop variable in the middle of a three-way
  comparison is not as apparent as the variable in the present ::

   for item in list

  syntax, leading to a possible loss of readability.  We feel that
  this loss is outweighed by the increase in readability from a
  natural integer iteration syntax.

- To some extent, this PEP addresses the same issues as :pep:`276`.
  We feel that the two PEPs are not in conflict since :pep:`276`
  is primarily concerned with half-open ranges starting in 0
  (the easy case of ``range()``) while this PEP is primarily concerned
  with simplifying all other cases.  However, if this PEP is
  approved, its new simpler syntax for integer loops could to some
  extent reduce the motivation for :pep:`276`.

- It is not clear whether it makes sense to allow floating point
  bounds for an integer loop: if a float represents an inexact
  value, how can it be used to determine an exact sequence of
  integers?  On the other hand, disallowing float bounds would
  make it difficult to use ``floor()`` and ``ceiling()`` in integer
  for-loops, as it is difficult to use them now with ``range()``.  We
  have erred on the side of flexibility, but this may lead to some
  implementation difficulties in determining the smallest and
  largest integer values that would cause a given comparison to be
  true.

- Should types other than int, long, and float be allowed as
  bounds?  Another choice would be to convert all bounds to
  integers by ``int()``, and allow as bounds anything that can be so
  converted instead of just floats.  However, this would change
  the semantics: ``0.3 <= x`` is not the same as ``int(0.3) <= x``, and it
  would be confusing for a loop with 0.3 as lower bound to start
  at zero.  Also, in general ``int(f)`` can be very far from ``f``.


Implementation
==============

An implementation is not available at this time.  Implementation
is not expected to pose any great difficulties: the new syntax
could, if necessary, be recognized by parsing a general expression
after each "for" keyword and testing whether the top level
operation of the expression is "in" or a three-way comparison.
The Python compiler would convert any instance of the new syntax
into a loop over the items in a special iterator object.
