Abstract
========

This PEP proposes to add a new ``tracemalloc`` module to trace memory
blocks allocated by Python.


Rationale
=========

Common debug tools tracing memory allocations record the C filename
and line number where the allocation occurs.  Using such tools to
analyze Python memory allocations does not help because most memory
blocks are allocated in the same C function, in ``PyMem_Malloc()`` for
example.

There are debug tools dedicated to the Python language like ``Heapy``
and ``PySizer``. These tools analyze objects type and/or content.
They are useful when most memory leaks are instances of the same type
and this type is only instantiated in a few functions. Problems arise
when the object type is very common like ``str`` or ``tuple``, and it
is hard to identify where these objects are instantiated.

Finding reference cycles is also a difficult problem.  There are
different tools to draw a diagram of all references.  These tools
cannot be used on large applications with thousands of objects because
the diagram is too huge to be analyzed manually.


Proposal
========

Using the customized allocation API from PEP 445, it becomes easy to
set up a hook on Python memory allocators. A hook can inspect Python
internals to retrieve Python tracebacks.

This PEP proposes to add a new ``tracemalloc`` module, as a debug tool
to trace memory blocks allocated by Python. The module provides the
following information:

* Computed differences between two snapshots to detect memory leaks
* Statistics on allocated memory blocks per filename and per line
  number: total size, number and average size of allocated memory blocks
* Traceback where a memory block was allocated

The API of the tracemalloc module is similar to the API of the
faulthandler module: ``enable()``, ``disable()`` and ``is_enabled()``
functions, an environment variable (``PYTHONFAULTHANDLER`` and
``PYTHONTRACEMALLOC``), and a ``-X`` command line option (``-X
faulthandler`` and ``-X tracemalloc``). See the
`documentation of the faulthandler module
<http://docs.python.org/3/library/faulthandler.html>`_.

The tracemalloc module has been written for CPython. Other
implementations of Python may not be able to provide it.


API
===

Main Functions
--------------

``clear_traces()`` function:

    Clear traces and statistics on Python memory allocations, and reset
    the ``get_traced_memory()`` counter.


``disable()`` function:

    Stop tracing Python memory allocations.

    See also ``enable()`` and ``is_enabled()`` functions.


``enable()`` function:

    Start tracing Python memory allocations.

    At fork, the module is automatically disabled in the child process.

    See also ``disable()`` and ``is_enabled()`` functions.


``get_stats()`` function:

    Get statistics on traced Python memory blocks as a dictionary
    ``{filename (str): {line_number (int): stats}}`` where *stats* in a
    ``(size: int, count: int)`` tuple, *filename* and *line_number* can
    be ``None``.

    Return an empty dictionary if the ``tracemalloc`` module is
    disabled.

    See also the ``get_traces()`` function.


``get_traced_memory()`` function:

    Get the current size and maximum size of memory blocks traced by the
    ``tracemalloc`` module as a tuple: ``(size: int, max_size: int)``.


``get_tracemalloc_memory()`` function:

    Get the memory usage in bytes of the ``tracemalloc`` module as a
    tuple: ``(size: int, free: int)``.

    * *size*: total size of bytes allocated by the module,
      including *free* bytes
    * *free*: number of free bytes available to store data


``is_enabled()`` function:

    ``True`` if the ``tracemalloc`` module is tracing Python memory
    allocations, ``False`` otherwise.

    See also ``enable()`` and ``disable()`` functions.


Trace Functions
---------------

``get_traceback_limit()`` function:

    Get the maximum number of frames stored in the traceback of a trace
    of a memory block.

    Use the ``set_traceback_limit()`` function to change the limit.


``get_object_address(obj)`` function:

    Get the address of the main memory block of the specified Python object.

    A Python object can be composed by multiple memory blocks, the
    function only returns the address of the main memory block.

    See also ``get_object_trace()`` and ``gc.get_referrers()`` functions.


``get_object_trace(obj)`` function:

    Get the trace of a Python object *obj* as a ``(size: int,
    traceback)`` tuple where *traceback* is a tuple of ``(filename: str,
    lineno: int)`` tuples, *filename* and *lineno* can be ``None``.

    The function only returns the trace of the main memory block of the
    object.  The *size* of the trace is smaller than the total size of
    the object if the object is composed by more than one memory block.

    Return ``None`` if the ``tracemalloc`` module did not trace the
    allocation of the object.

    See also ``get_object_address()``, ``get_trace()``,
    ``get_traces()``, ``gc.get_referrers()`` and ``sys.getsizeof()``
    functions.


``get_trace(address)`` function:

    Get the trace of a memory block as a ``(size: int, traceback)``
    tuple where *traceback* is a tuple of ``(filename: str, lineno:
    int)`` tuples, *filename* and *lineno* can be ``None``.

    Return ``None`` if the ``tracemalloc`` module did not trace the
    allocation of the memory block.

    See also ``get_object_trace()``, ``get_stats()`` and
    ``get_traces()`` functions.


``get_traces()`` function:

    Get traces of Python memory allocations as a dictionary ``{address
    (int): trace}`` where *trace* is a ``(size: int, traceback)`` and
    *traceback* is a list of ``(filename: str, lineno: int)``.
    *traceback* can be empty, *filename* and *lineno* can be None.

    Return an empty dictionary if the ``tracemalloc`` module is disabled.

    See also ``get_object_trace()``, ``get_stats()`` and ``get_trace()``
    functions.


``set_traceback_limit(nframe: int)`` function:

    Set the maximum number of frames stored in the traceback of a trace
    of a memory block.

    Storing the traceback of each memory allocation has an important
    overhead on the memory usage. Use the ``get_tracemalloc_memory()``
    function to measure the overhead and the ``add_filter()`` function
    to select which memory allocations are traced.

    Use the ``get_traceback_limit()`` function to get the current limit.


Filter Functions
----------------

``add_filter(filter)`` function:

    Add a new filter on Python memory allocations, *filter* is a
    ``Filter`` instance.

    All inclusive filters are applied at once, a memory allocation is
    only ignored if no inclusive filters match its trace. A memory
    allocation is ignored if at least one exclusive filter matchs its
    trace.

    The new filter is not applied on already collected traces. Use the
    ``clear_traces()`` function to ensure that all traces match the new
    filter.

``add_include_filter(filename: str, lineno: int=None, traceback: bool=False)`` function:

    Add an inclusive filter: helper for the ``add_filter()`` method
    creating a ``Filter`` instance with the ``Filter.include`` attribute
    set to ``True``.

    Example: ``tracemalloc.add_include_filter(tracemalloc.__file__)``
    only includes memory blocks allocated by the ``tracemalloc`` module.


``add_exclude_filter(filename: str, lineno: int=None, traceback: bool=False)`` function:

    Add an exclusive filter: helper for the ``add_filter()`` method
    creating a ``Filter`` instance with the ``Filter.include`` attribute
    set to ``False``.

    Example: ``tracemalloc.add_exclude_filter(tracemalloc.__file__)``
    ignores memory blocks allocated by the ``tracemalloc`` module.


``clear_filters()`` function:

    Reset the filter list.

    See also the ``get_filters()`` function.


``get_filters()`` function:

    Get the filters on Python memory allocations as list of ``Filter``
    instances.

    See also the ``clear_filters()`` function.


Filter
------

``Filter(include: bool, pattern: str, lineno: int=None, traceback: bool=False)`` class:

    Filter to select which memory allocations are traced. Filters can be
    used to reduce the memory usage of the ``tracemalloc`` module, which
    can be read using the ``get_tracemalloc_memory()`` function.

``match(filename: str, lineno: int)`` method:

    Return ``True`` if the filter matchs the filename and line number,
    ``False`` otherwise.

``match_filename(filename: str)`` method:

    Return ``True`` if the filter matchs the filename, ``False`` otherwise.

``match_lineno(lineno: int)`` method:

    Return ``True`` if the filter matchs the line number, ``False``
    otherwise.

``match_traceback(traceback)`` method:

    Return ``True`` if the filter matchs the *traceback*, ``False``
    otherwise.

    *traceback* is a tuple of ``(filename: str, lineno: int)`` tuples.

``include`` attribute:

    If *include* is ``True``, only trace memory blocks allocated in a
    file with a name matching filename ``pattern`` at line number
    ``lineno``.

    If *include* is ``False``, ignore memory blocks allocated in a file
    with a name matching filename ``pattern`` at line number ``lineno``.

``lineno`` attribute:

    Line number (``int``). If is is ``None`` or less than ``1``, it
    matches any line number.

``pattern`` attribute:

    The filename *pattern* can contain one or many ``*`` joker
    characters which match any substring, including an empty string. The
    ``.pyc`` and ``.pyo`` file extensions are replaced with ``.py``. On
    Windows, the comparison is case insensitive and the alternative
    separator ``/`` is replaced with the standard separator ``\``.

``traceback`` attribute:

    If *traceback* is ``True``, all frames of the traceback are checked.
    If *traceback* is ``False``, only the most recent frame is checked.

    This attribute is ignored if the traceback limit is less than ``2``.
    See the ``get_traceback_limit()`` function.


GroupedStats
------------

``GroupedStats(timestamp: datetime.datetime, stats: dict, group_by: str, cumulative=False, metrics: dict=None)`` class:

    Top of allocated memory blocks grouped by *group_by* as a
    dictionary.

    The ``Snapshot.top_by()`` method creates a ``GroupedStats``
    instance.

``compare_to(old_stats: GroupedStats=None)`` method:

    Compare to an older ``GroupedStats`` instance.  Return a
    ``StatsDiff`` instance.

    The ``StatsDiff.differences`` list is not sorted: call the
    ``StatsDiff.sort()`` method to sort the list.

    ``None`` values are replaced with an empty string for filenames or
    zero for line numbers, because ``str`` and ``int`` cannot be
    compared to ``None``.

``cumulative`` attribute:

    If ``True``, cumulate size and count of memory blocks of all frames
    of the traceback of a trace, not only the most recent frame.

``metrics`` attribute:

    Dictionary storing metrics read when the snapshot was created:
    ``{name (str): metric}`` where *metric* type is ``Metric``.

``group_by`` attribute:

    Determine how memory allocations were grouped: see
    ``Snapshot.top_by()`` for the available values.

``stats`` attribute:

    Dictionary ``{key: stats}`` where the *key* type depends on the
    ``group_by`` attribute and *stats* is a ``(size: int, count: int)``
    tuple.

    See the ``Snapshot.top_by()`` method.

``timestamp`` attribute:

    Creation date and time of the snapshot, ``datetime.datetime``
    instance.


Metric
------

``Metric(name: str, value: int, format: str)`` class:

    Value of a metric when a snapshot is created.

``name`` attribute:

    Name of the metric.

``value`` attribute:

    Value of the metric.

``format`` attribute:

    Format of the metric (``str``).


Snapshot
--------

``Snapshot(timestamp: datetime.datetime, traces: dict=None, stats: dict=None)`` class:

    Snapshot of traces and statistics on memory blocks allocated by Python.

``add_metric(name: str, value: int, format: str)`` method:

    Helper to add a ``Metric`` instance to ``Snapshot.metrics``.  Return
    the newly created ``Metric`` instance.

    Raise an exception if the name is already present in
    ``Snapshot.metrics``.


``apply_filters(filters)`` method:

    Apply filters on the ``traces`` and ``stats`` dictionaries,
    *filters* is a list of ``Filter`` instances.


``create(traces=False)`` classmethod:

    Take a snapshot of traces and/or statistics of allocated memory blocks.

    If *traces* is ``True``, ``get_traces()`` is called and its result
    is stored in the ``Snapshot.traces`` attribute. This attribute
    contains more information than ``Snapshot.stats`` and uses more
    memory and more disk space. If *traces* is ``False``,
    ``Snapshot.traces`` is set to ``None``.

    Tracebacks of traces are limited to ``traceback_limit`` frames. Call
    ``set_traceback_limit()`` before calling ``Snapshot.create()`` to
    store more frames.

    The ``tracemalloc`` module must be enabled to take a snapshot. See
    the the ``enable()`` function.

``get_metric(name, default=None)`` method:

    Get the value of the metric called *name*. Return *default* if the
    metric does not exist.


``load(filename, traces=True)`` classmethod:

    Load a snapshot from a file.

    If *traces* is ``False``, don't load traces.


``top_by(group_by: str, cumulative: bool=False)`` method:

    Compute top statistics grouped by *group_by* as a ``GroupedStats``
    instance:

    =====================  ========================  ================================
    group_by               description               key type
    =====================  ========================  ================================
    ``'filename'``         filename                  ``str``
    ``'line'``             filename and line number  ``(filename: str, lineno: int)``
    ``'address'``          memory block address      ``int``
    ``'traceback'``        traceback                 ``(address: int, traceback)``
    =====================  ========================  ================================

    The ``traceback`` type is a tuple of ``(filename: str, lineno:
    int)`` tuples, *filename* and *lineno* can be ``None``.

    If *cumulative* is ``True``, cumulate size and count of memory
    blocks of all frames of the traceback of a trace, not only the most
    recent frame.  The *cumulative* parameter is ignored if *group_by*
    is ``'address'`` or if the traceback limit is less than ``2``.


``write(filename)`` method:

    Write the snapshot into a file.


``metrics`` attribute:

    Dictionary storing metrics read when the snapshot was created:
    ``{name (str): metric}`` where *metric* type is ``Metric``.

``stats`` attribute:

    Statistics on traced Python memory, result of the ``get_stats()``
    function.

``traceback_limit`` attribute:

    Maximum number of frames stored in a trace of a memory block
    allocated by Python.

``traces`` attribute:

    Traces of Python memory allocations, result of the ``get_traces()``
    function, can be ``None``.

``timestamp`` attribute:

    Creation date and time of the snapshot, ``datetime.datetime``
    instance.


StatsDiff
---------

``StatsDiff(differences, old_stats, new_stats)`` class:

    Differences between two ``GroupedStats`` instances.

    The ``GroupedStats.compare_to()`` method creates a ``StatsDiff``
    instance.

``sort()`` method:

    Sort the ``differences`` list from the biggest difference to the
    smallest difference. Sort by ``abs(size_diff)``, *size*,
    ``abs(count_diff)``, *count* and then by *key*.

``differences`` attribute:

    Differences between ``old_stats`` and ``new_stats`` as a list of
    ``(size_diff, size, count_diff, count, key)`` tuples. *size_diff*,
    *size*, *count_diff* and *count* are ``int``. The key type depends
    on the ``GroupedStats.group_by`` attribute of ``new_stats``: see the
    ``Snapshot.top_by()`` method.
