Abstract
========

This PEP proposes to add a new ``tracemalloc`` module to trace memory
blocks allocated by Python.


Rationale
=========

Common debug tools tracing memory allocations record the C filename
and line number where the allocation occurs.  Using such a tool to
analyze Python memory allocations does not help because most memory
blocks are allocated in the same C function, in ``PyMem_Malloc()`` for
example.

There are debug tools dedicated to the Python language like ``Heapy``
and ``PySizer``. These tools analyze objects type and/or content.
They are useful when most memory leaks are instances of the same type
and this type is only instantiated in a few functions. Problems arise
when the object type is very common like ``str`` or ``tuple``, and it
is hard to identify where these objects are instantiated.

Finding reference cycles is also a difficult problem.  There are
different tools to draw a diagram of all references.  These tools
cannot be used on large applications with thousands of objects because
the diagram is too huge to be analyzed manually.


Proposal
========

Using the customized allocation API from PEP 445, it becomes easy to
set up a hook on Python memory allocators. A hook can inspect Python
internals to retrieve Python tracebacks.

This PEP proposes to add a new ``tracemalloc`` module, as a debug
tool to trace memory blocks allocated by Python. The module provides the
following information:

* Computed differences between two snapshots to detect memory leaks
* Statistics on allocated memory blocks per filename and per line
  number: total size, number and average size of allocated memory blocks
* Traceback where a memory block was allocated

The API of the tracemalloc module is similar to the API of the
faulthandler module: ``enable()``, ``disable()`` and ``is_enabled()``
functions, an environment variable (``PYTHONFAULTHANDLER`` and
``PYTHONTRACEMALLOC``), and a ``-X`` command line option (``-X
faulthandler`` and ``-X tracemalloc``). See the
`documentation of the faulthandler module
<http://docs.python.org/3/library/faulthandler.html>`_.

The tracemalloc module has been written for CPython. Other
implementations of Python may not be able to provide it.


API
===

To trace most memory blocks allocated by Python, the module should be
enabled as early as possible by setting the ``PYTHONTRACEMALLOC``
environment variable to ``1``, or by using ``-X tracemalloc`` command
line option. The ``tracemalloc.enable()`` function can also be called
to start tracing Python memory allocations.

By default, a trace of an allocated memory block only stores one
frame.  Use the ``set_traceback_limit()`` function to store additional
frames.

Python memory blocks allocated in the ``tracemalloc`` module itself are
also traced by default. Use ``add_exclude_filter(tracemalloc.__file__)``
to ignore these these memory allocations.

At fork, the module is automatically disabled in the child process.


Main Functions
--------------

``cancel_tasks()`` function:

    Cancel all scheduled tasks.

    See also the ``get_tasks()`` function.


``clear_traces()`` function:

    Clear all traces and statistics on Python memory allocations, and
    reset the ``get_arena_size()`` and ``get_traced_memory()``
    counters.


``disable()`` function:

    Stop tracing Python memory allocations and cancel scheduled tasks.

    See also ``enable()`` and ``is_enabled()`` functions.


``enable()`` function:

    Start tracing Python memory allocations.

    At fork, the module is automatically disabled in the child process.

    See also ``disable()`` and ``is_enabled()`` functions.


``get_stats()`` function:

    Get statistics on traced Python memory blocks as a dictionary
    ``{filename (str): {line_number (int): stats}}`` where *stats* in a
    ``(size: int, count: int)`` tuple, *filename* and *line_number* can
    be ``None``.

    Return an empty dictionary if the ``tracemalloc`` module is
    disabled.

    See also the ``get_traces()`` function.


``get_tasks()`` function:

    Get the list of scheduled tasks, list of ``Task`` instances.


``is_enabled()`` function:

    ``True`` if the ``tracemalloc`` module is tracing Python memory
    allocations, ``False`` otherwise.

    See also ``enable()`` and ``disable()`` functions.


Trace Functions
---------------

``get_traceback_limit()`` function:

    Get the maximum number of frames stored in the traceback of a
    trace of a memory block.

    Use the ``set_traceback_limit()`` function to change the limit.


``get_object_address(obj)`` function:

    Get the address of the memory block of the specified Python
    object.

    A Python object can be composed by multiple memory blocks, the
    function only returns the address of the main memory block.

    See also ``get_object_trace()`` and ``gc.get_referrers()``
    functions.


``get_object_trace(obj)`` function:

    Get the trace of a Python object *obj* as a ``(size: int,
    traceback)`` tuple where *traceback* is a tuple of ``(filename:
    str, lineno: int)`` tuples, *filename* and *lineno* can be
    ``None``.

    The function only returns the trace of the main memory block of
    the object.  The *size* of the trace is smaller than the total
    size of the object if the object is composed by more than one
    memory block.

    Return ``None`` if the ``tracemalloc`` module did not trace the
    allocation of the object.

    See also ``get_object_address()``, ``get_trace()``,
    ``get_traces()``, ``gc.get_referrers()`` and ``sys.getsizeof()``
    functions.


``get_trace(address)`` function:

    Get the trace of a memory block as a ``(size: int, traceback)``
    tuple where *traceback* is a tuple of ``(filename: str, lineno:
    int)`` tuples, *filename* and *lineno* can be ``None``.

    Return ``None`` if the ``tracemalloc`` module did not trace the
    allocation of the memory block.

    See also ``get_object_trace()``, ``get_stats()`` and
    ``get_traces()`` functions.


``get_traces()`` function:

    Get all traces of Python memory allocations as a dictionary
    ``{address (int): trace}`` where *trace* is a ``(size: int,
    traceback)`` and *traceback* is a list of ``(filename: str,
    lineno: int)``.  *traceback* can be empty, *filename* and *lineno*
    can be ``None``.

    Return an empty dictionary if the ``tracemalloc`` module is
    disabled.

    See also ``get_object_trace()``, ``get_stats()`` and
    ``get_trace()`` functions.


``set_traceback_limit(nframe: int)`` function:

    Set the maximum number of frames stored in the traceback of a
    trace of a memory block.

    Storing the traceback of each memory allocation has an important
    overhead on the memory usage. Use the ``get_tracemalloc_memory()``
    function to measure the overhead and the ``add_filter()`` function
    to select which memory allocations are traced.

    Use the ``get_traceback_limit()`` function to get the current limit.


Filter Functions
----------------

``add_filter(filter)`` function:

    Add a new filter on Python memory allocations, *filter* is a
    ``Filter`` instance.

    All inclusive filters are applied at once, a memory allocation is
    only ignored if no inclusive filter match its trace. A memory
    allocation is ignored if at least one exclusive filter matchs its
    trace.

    The new filter is not applied on already collected traces. Use the
    ``clear_traces()`` function to ensure that all traces match the
    new filter.

``add_include_filter(filename: str, lineno: int=None, traceback: bool=False)`` function:

    Add an inclusive filter: helper for the ``add_filter()`` method
    creating a ``Filter`` instance with the ``Filter.include``
    attribute set to ``True``.

    Example: ``tracemalloc.add_include_filter(tracemalloc.__file__)``
    only includes memory blocks allocated by the ``tracemalloc``
    module.


``add_exclude_filter(filename: str, lineno: int=None, traceback: bool=False)`` function:

    Add an exclusive filter: helper for the ``add_filter()`` method
    creating a ``Filter`` instance with the ``Filter.include``
    attribute set to ``False``.

    Example: ``tracemalloc.add_exclude_filter(tracemalloc.__file__)``
    ignores memory blocks allocated by the ``tracemalloc`` module.


``clear_filters()`` function:

    Reset the filter list.

    See also the ``get_filters()`` function.


``get_filters()`` function:

    Get the filters on Python memory allocations as list of ``Filter``
    instances.

    See also the ``clear_filters()`` function.

    int)`` tuple, *rss* is the "Resident Set Size" in bytes and *vms* is
    the size of the virtual memory in bytes

    Return ``None`` if the platform is not supported.

    Return ``True`` if the filter matchs the filename and line number,
    ``False`` otherwise.

``match_filename(filename: str)`` method:

    Return ``True`` if the filter matchs the filename, ``False``
    otherwise.

``match_lineno(lineno: int)`` method:

    file with a name matching filename ``pattern`` at line number
    ``lineno``.

    If *include* is ``False``, ignore memory blocks allocated in a file
    with a name matching filename :attr`pattern` at line number
    ``lineno``.

``lineno`` attribute:

    Line number (``int``). If is is ``None`` or less than ``1``, it
    matches any line number.

``pattern`` attribute:

    The filename *pattern* can contain one or many ``*`` joker
    characters which match any substring, including an empty string. The
    ``.pyc`` and ``.pyo`` file extensions are replaced with ``.py``. On
    Windows, the comparison is case insensitive and the alternative
    separator ``/`` is replaced with the standard separator ``\``.

``traceback`` attribute:

    If *traceback* is ``True``, all frames of the traceback are checked.
    If *traceback* is ``False``, only the most recent frame is checked.

    This attribute is ignored if the traceback limit is less than ``2``.
    See the ``get_traceback_limit()`` function.


GroupedStats
------------

``GroupedStats(timestamp: datetime.datetime, stats: dict, group_by: str, cumulative=False, metrics: dict=None)`` class:

    Compare to an older ``GroupedStats`` instance.  Return a
    ``StatsDiff`` instance.

    The ``StatsDiff.differences`` list is not sorted: call the
    ``StatsDiff.sort`` method to sort the list.

    ``None`` values are replaced with an empty string for filenames or
    zero for line numbers, because ``str`` and ``int`` cannot be
    compared to ``None``.

``cumulative`` attribute:

    If ``True``, cumulate size and count of memory blocks of all frames
    of the traceback of a trace, not only the most recent frame.

    *filters* is a list of ``Filter`` instances.


``create(traces=False, metrics=True)`` classmethod:

    Take a snapshot of traces and/or statistics of allocated memory
    blocks.

    If *traces* is ``True``, ``get_traces`` is called and its result is
    stored in the ``Snapshot.traces`` attribute. This attribute contains
    more information than ``Snapshot.stats`` and uses more memory and
    more disk space. If *traces* is ``False``, ``Snapshot.traces`` is

    * ``add_tracemalloc_metrics``
    * ``add_unicode_metrics``

    If *metrics* is ``False``, ``Snapshot.metrics`` is set to an empty
    dictionary.

    Tracebacks of traces are limited to ``traceback_limit`` frames. Call
    ``set_traceback_limit()`` before calling ``Snapshot.create()`` to
    store more frames.

    The ``tracemalloc`` module must be enabled to take a snapshot. See
    the the ``enable()`` function.

    Get the value of the metric called *name*. Return *default* if the
    metric does not exist.


``load(filename, traces=True)`` classmethod:

    If *traces* is ``False``, don't load traces.


``top_by(group_by: str, cumulative: bool=False)`` method:

    Compute top statistics grouped by *group_by* as a ``GroupedStats``
    instance:

    =====================  ========================  ==============
    ``'filename'``         filename                  ``str``
    ``'line'``             filename and line number  ``(str, int)``
    ``'address'``          memory block address      ``int``
    =====================  ========================  ==============

    If *cumulative* is ``True``, cumulate size and count of memory
    blocks of all frames of the traceback of a trace, not only the most
    recent frame.  The *cumulative* parameter is ignored if *group_by*
    is ``'address'`` or if the traceback limit is less than ``2``.


``write(filename)`` method:

      Write the snapshot into a file.


``metrics`` attribute:

    Dictionary storing metrics read when the snapshot was created:
    ``{name (str): metric}`` where *metric* type is ``Metric``.

``pid`` attribute:

    Identifier of the process which created the snapshot, result of
    ``os.getpid()``.

``stats`` attribute:

    Statistics on traced Python memory, result of the ``get_stats()``
    function.

``traceback_limit`` attribute:

    Maximum number of frames stored in a trace of a memory block
    allocated by Python.

``traces`` attribute:

    Traces of Python memory allocations, result of the ``get_traces()``
    function, can be ``None``.

``timestamp`` attribute:

    Creation date and time of the snapshot, ``datetime.datetime``
    instance.


StatsDiff
---------

``StatsDiff(differences, old_stats, new_stats)`` class:

    Differences between two ``GroupedStats`` instances.

    The ``GroupedStats.compare_to`` method creates a ``StatsDiff``
    instance.

``sort()`` method:

    Sort the ``differences`` list from the biggest difference to the
    smallest difference. Sort by ``abs(size_diff)``, *size*,
    ``abs(count_diff)``, *count* and then by *key*.

``differences`` attribute:

    Differences between ``old_stats`` and ``new_stats`` as a list of
    ``(size_diff, size, count_diff, count, key)`` tuples. *size_diff*,
    *size*, *count_diff* and *count* are ``int``. The key type depends
    on the ``GroupedStats.group_by`` attribute of ``new_stats``: see
    the ``Snapshot.top_by()`` method.

``old_stats`` attribute:

    Old ``GroupedStats`` instance, can be ``None``.

``new_stats`` attribute:

    New ``GroupedStats`` instance.


Task
----

``Task(func, *args, **kw)`` class:

    Task calling ``func(*args, **kw)``. When scheduled, the task is
    called when the traced memory is increased or decreased by more
    than *threshold* bytes, or after *delay* seconds.

``call()`` method:

    Call ``func(*args, **kw)`` and return the result.


``cancel()`` method:

    Cancel the task.

    Do nothing if the task is not scheduled.


``get_delay()`` method:

    Get the delay in seconds. If the delay is ``None``, the timer is
    disabled.


``get_memory_threshold()`` method:

    Get the threshold of the traced memory. When scheduled, the task
    is called when the traced memory is increased or decreased by more
    than *threshold* bytes. The memory threshold is disabled if
    *threshold* is ``None``.

    See also the ``set_memory_threshold()`` method and the
    ``get_traced_memory()`` function.


``schedule(repeat: int=None)`` method:

    Schedule the task *repeat* times. If *repeat* is ``None``, the
    task is rescheduled after each call until it is cancelled.

    If the method is called twice, the task is rescheduled with the
    new *repeat* parameter.

    The task must have a memory threshold or a delay: see
    ``set_delay()`` and ``set_memory_threshold()`` methods. The
    ``tracemalloc`` must be enabled to schedule a task: see the
    ``enable`` function.

    The task is cancelled if the ``call()`` method raises an
    exception.  The task can be cancelled using the ``cancel()``
    method or the ``cancel_tasks()`` function.


``set_delay(seconds: int)`` method:

    Set the delay in seconds before the task will be called. Set the
    delay to ``None`` to disable the timer.

    The timer is based on the Python memory allocator, it is not real
    time.  The task is called after at least *delay* seconds, it is
    not called exactly after *delay* seconds if no Python memory
    allocation occurred.  The timer has a resolution of 1 second.

    The task is rescheduled if it was scheduled.


``set_memory_threshold(size: int)`` method:

    Set the threshold of the traced memory. When scheduled, the task
    is called when the traced memory is increased or decreased by more
    than *threshold* bytes. Set the threshold to ``None`` to disable
    it.

    The task is rescheduled if it was scheduled.

    See also the ``get_memory_threshold()`` method and the
    ``get_traced_memory()`` function.


``func`` attribute:

    Function, callable object.

``func_args`` attribute:

    Function arguments, ``tuple``.

``func_kwargs`` attribute:

    Function keyword arguments, ``dict``. It can be ``None``.


TakeSnapshotTask
----------------

``TakeSnapshotTask(filename_template: str="tracemalloc-$counter.pickle", traces: bool=False, metrics: bool=True, callback: callable=None)`` class:

    Task taking snapshots of Python memory allocations and writing them
    into files.

    ``TakeSnapshotTask`` is based on the ``Task`` class and so inherit
    all attributes and methods, especially:

    * ``Task.cancel()``
    * ``Task.schedule()``
    * ``Task.set_delay()``
    * ``Task.set_memory_threshold()``

``take_snapshot()`` method:

    Take a snapshot and write it into a file.  Return ``(snapshot,
    filename)`` where *snapshot* is a ``Snapshot`` instance and
    filename type is ``str``.

``callback`` attribute:

    *callback* is an optional callable object which can be used to add
    metrics to a snapshot. It is called with only one parameter: the
    newly created snapshot instance. Use the ``Snapshot.add_metric()``
    method to add new metric.

``filename_template`` attribute:

    Template to create a filename. The template supports the following
    variables:

    * ``$pid``: identifier of the current process
    * ``$timestamp``: current date and time
    * ``$counter``: counter starting at 1 and incremented at each
      snapshot, formatted as 4 decimal digits

    The default template is ``'tracemalloc-$counter.pickle'``.

``metrics`` attribute:

    Parameter passed to the ``Snapshot.create()`` function.

``traces`` attribute:

    Parameter passed to the ``Snapshot.create()`` function.
