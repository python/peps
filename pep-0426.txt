Abstract
========

This PEP describes a mechanism for publishing and exchanging metadata
related to Python distributions. It includes specifics of the field names,
and their semantics and
usage.

This document specifies version 2.0 of the metadata format.
Version 1.0 is specified in PEP 241.
Version 1.1 is specified in PEP 314.
Version 1.2 is specified in PEP 345.

Version 2.0 of the metadata format migrates from a custom key-value format
to a JSON-compatible in-memory representation.

This version also adds fields designed to make third-party packaging of
Python software easier, defines a formal extension mechanism, and adds
support for optional dependencies. Finally, this version addresses
several issues with the previous iteration of the standard version
identification scheme.

.. note::

   "I" in this doc refers to Nick Coghlan. Daniel and Donald either wrote or
   contributed to earlier versions, and have been providing feedback as this
   initial draft of the JSON-based rewrite has taken shape.

   Metadata 2.0 represents a major upgrade to the Python packaging ecosystem,
   and attempts to incorporate experience gained over the 15 years(!) since
   distutils was first added to the standard library. Some of that is just
   incorporating existing practices from setuptools/pip/etc, some of it is
   copying from other distribution systems (like Linux distros or other
   development language communities) and some of it is attempting to solve
   problems which haven't yet been well solved by anyone (like supporting
   clean conversion of Python source packages to distro policy compliant
   source packages for at least Debian and Fedora, and perhaps other
   platform specific distribution systems).

   There will eventually be a suite of PEPs covering various aspects of
   the metadata 2.0 format and related systems:

   * this PEP, covering the core metadata format
   * PEP 440, covering the versioning identification and selection scheme
   * a new PEP to define v2.0 of the sdist format
   * an updated wheel PEP (v1.1) to add pymeta.json
   * an updated installation database PEP both for pymeta.json and to add
     a linking scheme to better support runtime selection of dependencies,
     as well as recording which extras are currently available
   * a new static config PEP to standardise metadata generation and
     creation of sdists
   * PEP 439, covering a bootstrapping mechanism for ``pip``
   * a distutils upgrade PEP, adding metadata v2.0 and wheel support.

   It's going to take a while to work through all of these and make them
   a reality. The main change from our last attempt at this is that we're
   trying to design the different pieces so we can implement them
   independently of each other, without requiring users to switch to
   a whole new tool chain (although they may have to upgrade their existing
   ones to start enjoying the benefits in their own work).

   Many of the inline notes in this version of the PEP are there to aid
   reviewers that are familiar with the old metadata standards. Before this
   version is finalised, most of that content will be moved down to the
   "rationale" section at the end of the document, as it would otherwise be
   an irrelevant distraction for future readers.


Definitions
===========

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

"Distributions" are deployable software components published through an index
server or otherwise made available for installation.

"Versions" are uniquely identified snapshots of a distribution.

"Distribution archives" are the packaged files which are used to publish
and distribute the software.

"Source archives" require build tools to be available on the target
system.

"Binary archives" only require that prebuilt files be moved to the correct
location on the target system. As Python is a dynamically bound
cross-platform language, many "binary" archives will contain only pure
Python source code.

"Build tools" are automated tools intended to run on development systems,
producing source and binary distribution archives. Build tools may also be
invoked by installation tools in order to install software distributed as
source archives rather than prebuilt binary archives.

"Index servers" are active distribution registries which publish version and
dependency metadata and place constraints on the permitted metadata.

"Publication tools" are automated tools intended to run on development
systems and upload source and binary distribution archives to index servers.

"Installation tools" are automated tools intended to run on production
systems, consuming source and binary distribution archives from an index
server or other designated location and deploying them to the target system.

"Automated tools" is a collective term covering build tools, index servers,
publication tools, installation tools and any other software that produces
or consumes distribution version and dependency metadata.

"Projects" refers to the developers that manage the creation of a particular
distribution.

"Legacy metadata" refers to earlier versions of this metadata specification,
along with the supporting metadata file formats defined by the
``setuptools`` project.


Development and distribution activities
=======================================

Making effective use of a common metadata format requires a common
understanding of the most complex development and distribution model
the format is intended to support. The metadata format described in this
PEP is based on the following activities:

* Development: during development, a user is operating from a
  source checkout (or equivalent) for the current project. Dependencies must
  be available in order to build, test and create a source archive of the
  distribution.

  .. note::
     As a generated file, the full distribution metadata often won't be
     available in a raw source checkout or tarball. In such cases, the
     relevant distribution metadata is generally obtained from another
     location, such as the last published release, or by generating it
     based on a command given in a standard input file. This spec
     deliberately avoids handling that scenario, instead falling back on
     the existing ``setup.py`` functionality.

* Build: the build step is the process of turning a source archive into a
  binary archive. Dependencies must be available in order to build and
  create a binary archive of the distribution (including any documentation
  that is installed on target systems).

* Deployment: the deployment phase consists of two subphases:

  * Installation: the installation phase involves getting the distribution
    and all of its runtime dependencies onto the target system. In this
    phase, the distribution may already be on the system (when upgrading or
    reinstalling) or else it may be a completely new installation.

  * Usage: the usage phase, also referred to as "runtime", is normal usage
    of the distribution after it has been installed on the target system.

The metadata format described in this PEP is designed to enable the
following:

* It should be practical to have separate development systems, build systems
  and deployment systems.
* It should be practical to install dependencies needed specifically to
  build source archives only on development systems.
* It should be practical to install dependencies needed specifically to
  build the software only on development and build systems, as well as
  optionally on deployment systems if installation from source archives
  is needed.
* It should be practical to install dependencies needed to run the
  distribution only on development and deployment systems.
* It should be practical to install the dependencies needed to run a
  distribution's test suite only on development systems, as well as
  optionally on deployment systems.
* It should be practical for repackagers to separate out the build
  dependencies needed to build the application itself from those required
  to build its documentation (as the documentation often doesn't need to
  be rebuilt when porting an application to a different platform).

.. note::

    This "most complex supported scenario" is almost *exactly* what has to
    happen to get an upstream Python package into a Linux distribution, and
    is why the current crop of automatic Python metadata -> Linux distro
    metadata converters have some serious issues, at least from the point of
    view of complying with distro packaging policies: the information
    they need to comply with those policies isn't available from the
    upstream projects, and all current formats for publishing it are
    distro specific. This means either upstreams have to maintain metadata
    for multiple distributions (which rarely happens) or else repackagers
    have to do a lot of work manually in order to separate out these
    dependencies in a  way that complies with those policies.

    One thing this PEP aims to do is define a metadata format that at least
    has the *potential* to provide the info repackagers need, thus allowing
    upstream Python projects and Linux distro repackagers to collaborate more
    effectively (and, ideally, make it possible to reliably automate
    the process of converting upstream Python distributions into policy
    compliant distro packages).

    Some items in this section (and the contents of this note) will likely
    end up moving down to the "Rationale for changes from PEP 345" section.


Metadata format
===============

The format defined in this PEP is an in-memory representation of Python
distribution metadata as a string-keyed dictionary. Permitted values for
individual entries are strings, lists of strings, and additional
nested string-keyed dictionaries.

Except where otherwise noted, dictionary keys in distribution metadata MUST
be valid Python identifiers in order to support attribute based metadata
access APIs.

The individual field descriptions show examples of the key name and value
as they would be serialised as part of a JSON mapping.

The fields identified as core metadata are required. Automated tools MUST
NOT accept distributions with missing core metadata as valid Python
distributions.

All other fields are optional. Automated tools MUST operate correctly
if a distribution does not provide them, except for those operations
which specifically require the omitted fields.

Automated tools MUST NOT insert dummy data for missing fields. If a valid
value is not provided for a required field then the metadata and the
associated distribution MUST be rejected as invalid. If a valid value
is not provided for an optional field, that field MUST be omitted entirely.
Automated tools MAY automatically derive valid values from other
information sources (such as a version control system).


Metadata files
--------------

The information defined in this PEP is serialised to ``pymeta.json``
files for some use cases. As indicated by the extension, these
are JSON-encoded files. Each file consists of a single serialised mapping,
with fields as described in this PEP.

There are three standard locations for these metadata files:

* as a ``{distribution}-{version}.dist-info/pymeta.json`` file in an
  ``sdist`` source distribution archive
* as a ``{distribution}-{version}.dist-info/pymeta.json`` file in a ``wheel``
  binary distribution archive
* as a ``{distribution}-{version}.dist-info/pymeta.json`` file in a local
  Python installation database

.. note::

   These locations are to be confirmed, since they depend on the definition
   of sdist 2.0 and the revised installation database standard. There will
   also be a wheel 1.1 format update after this PEP is approved that
   mandates 2.0+ metadata.

Other tools involved in Python distribution may also use this format.

It is expected that these metadata files will be generated by build tools
based on other input formats (such as ``setup.py``) rather than being
edited by hand.

.. note::

    It may be appropriate to add a "./setup.py dist_info" command to
    setuptools to allow just the sdist metadata files to be generated
    without having to build the full sdist archive. This would be
    similar to the existing "./setup.py egg_info" command in setuptools,
    which would continue to emit the legacy metadata format.

For backwards compatibility with older installation tools, metadata 2.0
files MAY be distributed alongside legacy metadata.

Index servers MAY allow distributions to be uploaded and installation tools
MAY allow distributions to be installed with only legacy metadata.


Essential dependency resolution metadata
----------------------------------------

For dependency resolution purposes, it is useful to have a minimal subset
of the metadata that contains only those fields needed to identify
distributions and resolve dependencies between them.

The essential dependency resolution metadata consists of the following
fields:

* ``metadata_version``
* ``name``
* ``version``
* ``build_label``
* ``version_url``
* ``extras``
* ``requires``
* ``may-require``
* ``build-requires``
* ``build-may-require``
* ``dev-requires``
* ``dev-may-require``
* ``provides``
* ``obsoleted_by``
* ``supports_environments``

When serialised to a file, the name used for this metadata set SHOULD
be ``pymeta-minimal.json``.

Abbreviated metadata
--------------------

Some metadata fields have the potential to contain a lot of information
that will rarely be referenced, greatly increasing storage requirements
without providing significant benefits.

The abbreviated metadata for a distribution consists of all fields
*except* the following:

* ``description``
* ``contributors``

When serialised to a file, the name used for this metadata set SHOULD
be ``pymeta-short.json``.


Core metadata
=============

This section specifies the core metadata fields that are required for every
Python distribution.

Publication tools MUST ensure at least these fields are present when
publishing a distribution.

Index servers MUST ensure at least these fields are present in the metadata
when distributions are uploaded.

Installation tools MUST refuse to install distributions with one or more
of these fields missing by default, but MAY allow users to force such an
installation to occur.


Metadata version
----------------

Version of the file format; ``"2.0"`` is the only legal value.

Automated tools consuming metadata SHOULD warn if ``metadata_version`` is
greater than the highest version they support, and MUST fail if
``metadata_version`` has a greater major version than the highest
version they support (as described in PEP 440, the major version is the
value before the first dot).

For broader compatibility, build tools MAY choose to produce
distribution metadata using the lowest metadata version that includes
all of the needed fields.

Example::

    "metadata_version": "2.0"


Name
----

The name of the distribution.

As distribution names are used as part of URLs, filenames, command line
parameters and must also interoperate with other packaging systems, the
permitted characters are constrained to:

* ASCII letters (``[a-zA-Z]``)
* ASCII digits (``[0-9]``)
* underscores (``_``)
* hyphens (``-``)
* periods (``.``)

Distributions named MUST start and end with an ASCII letter or digit.

Automated tools MUST reject non-compliant names.

All comparisons of distribution names MUST be case insensitive, and MUST
consider hyphens and underscores to be equivalent.

Index servers MAY consider "confusable" characters (as defined by the
Unicode Consortium in `TR39: Unicode Security Mechanisms <TR39>`__) to be
equivalent.

Index servers that permit arbitrary distribution name registrations from
untrusted sources SHOULD consider confusable characters to be equivalent
when registering new distributions (and hence reject them as duplicates).

Installation tools MUST NOT silently accept a confusable alternate
spelling as matching a requested distribution name.

At time of writing, the characters in the ASCII subset designated as
confusables by the Unicode Consortium are:

* ``1`` (DIGIT ONE), ``l`` (LATIN SMALL LETTER L), and ``I`` (LATIN CAPITAL
  LETTER I)
* ``0`` (DIGIT ZERO), and ``O`` (LATIN CAPITAL LETTER O)


Example::

    "name": "ComfyChair"

.. note::

    Debian doesn't actually permit underscores in names, but that seems
    unduly restrictive for this spec given the common practice of using
    valid Python identifiers as Python distribution names. A Debian side
    policy of converting underscores to hyphens seems easy enough to
    implement (and the requirement to consider hyphens and underscores as
    equivalent ensures that doing so won't introduce any conflicts).

    We're deliberately *not* following Python 3 down the path of arbitrary
    unicode identifiers at this time. The security implications of doing so
    are substantially worse in the software distribution use case (it opens
    up far more interesting attack vectors than mere code obfuscation), the
    existing tooling really only works properly if you abide by the stated
    restrictions and changing it would require a *lot* of work for all
    the automated tools in the chain.

    PyPI has recently been updated to reject non-compliant names for newly
    registered projects, but existing non-compliant names are still
    tolerated when using legacy metadata formats. Affected distributions
    will need to change their names (typically be replacing spaces with
    hyphens) before they can migrate to the new metadata formats.

    Donald Stufft ran an analysis, and the new restrictions impact less
    than 230 projects out of the ~31k already on PyPI. This isn't that
    surprising given the fact that many existing tools could already
    exhibit odd behaviour when attempting to deal with non-compliant
    names, implicitly discouraging the use of more exotic names.

    Of those projects, ~200 have the only non-compliant character as an
    internal space (e.g. "Twisted Web"). These will be automatically
    migrated by replacing the spaces with hyphens (e.g. "Twisted-Web"),
    which is what you have to actually type to install these distributions
    with ``setuptools`` (which powers both ``easy_install`` and ``pip``).

    The remaining ~30 will be investigated manually and decided upon on a
    case by case basis how to migrate them to the new naming rules (in
    consultation with the maintainers of those projects where possible).


Version
-------

The distribution's public version identifier, as defined in PEP 440. Public
versions are designed for consumption by automated tools and support a
variety of flexible version specification mechanisms (see PEP 440 for
details).

Example::

    "version": "1.0a2"


Additional identifying metadata
===============================

This section specifies fields that provide other identifying details
that are unique to this distribution.

All of these fields are optional. Automated tools MUST operate correctly if
a distribution does not provide them, including failing cleanly when an
operation depending on one of these fields is requested.


Build label
-----------

A constrained identifying text string, as defined in PEP 440. Build labels
cannot be used in ordered version comparisons, but may be used to select
an exact version (see PEP 440 for details).


Examples::

    "build_label": "1.0.0-alpha.1"

    "build_label": "1.3.7+build.11.e0f985a"

    "build_label": "v1.8.1.301.ga0df26f"

    "build_label": "2013.02.17.dev123"


Version URL
-----------

A string containing a full URL where this specific version of the
distribution can be downloaded.  (This means that the URL can't be
something like ``"https://github.com/pypa/pip/archive/master.zip"``, but
instead must be ``"https://github.com/pypa/pip/archive/1.3.1.zip"``.)

Some appropriate targets for a version URL are a source tarball, an sdist
archive or a direct reference to a tag or specific commit in an online
version control system.

All version URL references SHOULD either specify a secure transport
mechanism (such as ``https``) or else include an expected hash value in the
URL for verification purposes. If an insecure transport is specified without
any hash information (or with hash information that the tool doesn't
understand), automated tools SHOULD at least emit a warning and MAY
refuse to rely on the URL.

It is RECOMMENDED that only hashes which are unconditionally provided by
the latest version of the standard library's ``hashlib`` module be used
for source archive hashes. At time of writing, that list consists of
``'md5'``, ``'sha1'``, ``'sha224'``, ``'sha256'``, ``'sha384'``, and
``'sha512'``.

For source archive references, an expected hash value may be specified by
including a ``<hash-algorithm>=<expected-hash>`` as part of the URL
fragment.

For version control references, the ``VCS+protocol`` scheme SHOULD be
used to identify both the version control system and the secure transport.

To support version control systems that do not support including commit or
tag references directly in the URL, that information may be appended to the
end of the URL using the ``@<tag>`` notation.

Example::

    "version_url": "https://github.com/pypa/pip/archive/1.3.1.zip"
    "version_url": "http://github.com/pypa/pip/archive/1.3.1.zip#sha1=da9234ee9982d4bbb3c72346a6de940a148ea686"
    "version_url": "git+https://github.com/pypa/pip.git@1.3.1"

.. note::

    This was called "Download-URL" in previous versions of the metadata. It
    has been renamed, since there are plenty of other download locations and
    this URL is meant to be a way to get the original source for development
    purposes (or to generate an SRPM or other platform specific equivalent).

    For extra fun and games, it appears that unlike "svn+ssh://",
    neither "git+ssh://" nor "hg+ssh://" natively support direct linking to a
    particular tag (hg does support direct links to bookmarks through the URL
    fragment, but that doesn't help for git and doesn't appear to be what I
    want anyway).

    However pip does have a `defined convention
    <http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/logic.html#vcs-support>`__ for
    this kind of link, which effectively splits a "URL" into "<repo>@<tag>".

    The PEP simply adopts pip's existing solution to this problem.

    This field is separate from the project URLs, as it's expected to
    change for each version, while the project URLs are expected to
    be fairly stable.


Additional descriptive metadata
===============================

This section specifies fields that provide additional information regarding
the distribution and its contents.

All of these fields are optional. Automated tools MUST operate correctly if
a distribution does not provide them, including failing cleanly when an
operation depending on one of these fields is requested.

Summary
-------

A one-line summary of what the distribution does.

Publication tools SHOULD emit a warning if this field is not provided. Index
servers MAY require that this field be present before allowing a
distribution to be uploaded.

Example::

    "summary": "A module that is more fiendish than soft cushions."

.. note::

   This used to be mandatory, and it's still highly recommended, but really,
   nothing should break even when it's missing.


Description
-----------

The distribution metadata should include a longer description of the
distribution that may run to several paragraphs. Software that deals
with metadata should not assume any maximum size for the description.

The distribution description can be written using reStructuredText
markup [1]_.  For programs that work with the metadata, supporting
markup is optional; programs may also display the contents of the
field as plain text without any special formatting.  This means that
authors should be conservative in the markup they use.

Example::

    "description": "The ComfyChair module replaces SoftCushions.\\n\\nUse until lunchtime, but pause for a cup of coffee at eleven."

.. note::

   The difficulty of editing this field in a raw JSON file is one of the
   main reasons this metadata interchange format is NOT recommended for
   use as an input format for build tools.


Description Format
------------------

A field indicating the intended format of the text in the description field.
This allows index servers to render the description field correctly and
provide feedback on rendering errors, rather than having to guess the
intended format.

If this field is omitted, or contains an unrecognised value, the default
rendering format MUST be plain text.

The following format names SHOULD be used for the specified markup formats:

* ``txt``: Plain text (default handling if field is omitted)
* ``rst``: reStructured Text
* ``md``: Markdown (exact syntax variant will be implementation dependent)
* ``adoc``: AsciiDoc
* ``html``: HTML

Automated tools MAY render one or more of the listed formats as plain
text and MAY accept other markup formats beyond those listed.

Example::

    "description_format": "rst"


Keywords
--------

A list of additional keywords to be used to assist searching for the
distribution in a larger catalog.

Example::

    "keywords": ["comfy", "chair", "cushions", "too silly", "monty python"]


License
-------

A string indicating the license covering the distribution where the license
is not a simple selection from the "License" Trove classifiers. See
Classifiers" below.  This field may also be used to specify a
particular version of a license which is named via the ``Classifier``
field, or to indicate a variation or exception to such a license.

Example::

    "license": "GPL version 3, excluding DRM provisions"


License URL
-----------

A specific URL referencing the full licence text for this version of the
distribution.

Example::

    "license_url": "https://github.com/pypa/pip/blob/1.3.1/LICENSE.txt"

.. note::

   Like Version URL, this is handled separately from the project URLs
   as it is important that it remain accurate for this *specific*
   version of the distribution, even if the project later switches to a
   different license.

   The project URLs field is intended for more stable references.


Classifiers
-----------

A list of strings, with each giving a single classification value
for the distribution.  Classifiers are described in PEP 301 [2].

Example::

    "classifiers": [
        "Development Status :: 4 - Beta",
        "Environment :: Console (Text Based)"
    ]


Contact metadata
================

Contact metadata for a distribution is provided to allow users to get
access to more information about the distribution and its maintainers.

These details are recorded as mappings with the following subfields:

* ``name``: the name of an individual or group
* ``email``: an email address (this may be a mailing list)
* ``url``: a URL (such as a profile page on a source code hosting service)
* ``type``: one of ``"author"``, ``"maintainer"``, ``"organization"``
  or ``"individual"``

The ``name`` subfield is required, the other subfields are optional.

If no specific contact type is stated, the default is ``individual``.

The different contact types are as follows:

* ``author``: the original creator of a distribution
* ``maintainer``: the current lead contributor for a distribution, when
  they are not the original creator
* ``individual``: any other individuals involved in the creation of the
  distribution
* ``organization``: indicates that these contact details are for an
  organization (formal or informal) rather than for a specific individual

.. note::

   This is admittedly a little complicated, but it's designed to replace the
   Author, Author-Email, Maintainer, Maintainer-Email fields from metadata
   1.2 in a way that allows those distinctions to be fully represented for
   lossless translation, while allowing future distributions to pretty
   much ignore everything other than the contact/contributor distinction
   if they so choose.

Contact metadata is optional. Automated tools MUST operate correctly if
a distribution does not provide them, including failing cleanly when an
operation depending on one of these fields is requested.


Contacts
--------

A list of contact entries giving the recommended contact points for getting
more information about the project.

The example below would be suitable for a project that was in the process
of handing over from the original author to a new lead maintainer, while
operating as part of a larger development group.

Example::

    "contacts": [
      {
        "name": "Python Packaging Authority/Distutils-SIG",
        "type": "organization",
        "email": "distutils-sig@python.org",
        "url": "https://bitbucket.org/pypa/"
      },
      {
        "name": "Samantha C.",
        "type": "maintainer",
        "email": "dontblameme@example.org"
      },
      {
        "name": "Charlotte C.",
        "type": "author",
        "email": "iambecomingasketchcomedian@example.com"
      }
    ]


Contributors
------------

A list of contact entries for other contributors not already listed as
current project points of contact. The subfields within the list elements
are the same as those for the main contact field.

Example::

    "contributors": [
        {"name": "John C."},
        {"name": "Erik I."},
        {"name": "Terry G."},
        {"name": "Mike P."},
        {"name": "Graeme C."},
        {"name": "Terry J."}
    ]


Project URLs
------------

A mapping of arbitrary text labels to additional URLs relevant to the
project.

While projects are free to choose their own labels and specific URLs,
it is RECOMMENDED that home page, source control, issue tracker and
documentation links be provided using the labels in the example below.

URL labels MUST be treated as case insensitive by automated tools, but they
are not required to be valid Python identifiers. Any legal JSON string is
permitted as a URL label.

Example::

    "project_urls": {
        "Documentation": "https://distlib.readthedocs.org"
        "Home": "https://bitbucket.org/pypa/distlib"
        "Source": "https://bitbucket.org/pypa/distlib/src"
        "Tracker": "https://bitbucket.org/pypa/distlib/issues"
    }


Dependency metadata
===================

Dependency metadata allows distributions to make use of functionality
provided by other distributions, without needing to bundle copies of those
distributions.

Dependency management is heavily dependent on the version identification
and specification scheme defined in PEP 440.

.. note::

    This substantially changes the old two-phase setup vs runtime dependency
    model in metadata 1.2 (which was in turn derived from the setuptools
    dependency parameters). The translation is that ``dev_requires`` and
    ``build_requires`` both map to ``Setup-Requires-Dist``
    in 1.2, while ``requires`` maps to ``Requires-Dist``. To go the other
    way, ``Setup-Requires-Dist`` maps to ``build_requires`` and
    ``Requires-Dist`` maps to ``requires``.

All of these fields are optional. Automated tools MUST operate correctly if
a distribution does not provide them, by assuming that a missing field
indicates "Not applicable for this distribution".


Dependency specifications
-------------------------

Individual dependencies are typically defined as strings containing a
distribution name (as found in the ``name`` field). The dependency name
may be followed by an extras specifier (enclosed in square
brackets) and by a version specification (within parentheses).

See `Extras (optional dependencies)`_ for details on extras and PEP 440
for details on version specifiers.

The distribution names should correspond to names as found on the `Python
Package Index`_; while these names are often the same as the module names
as accessed with ``import x``, this is not always the case (especially
for distributions that provide multiple top level modules or packages).

Example dependency specifications::

    "Flask"
    "Django"
    "Pyramid"
    "SciPy (0.12)"
    "ComfyChair[warmup]"
    "ComfyChair[warmup] (> 0.1)"


Conditional dependencies
------------------------

While many dependencies will be needed to use a distribution at all, others
are needed only on particular platforms or only when particular optional
features of the distribution are needed. To enable this, dependency fields
are marked as either unconditional (indicated by ``requires`` in the field
name) or conditional (indicated by ``may_require``) in the field name.

Unconditional dependency fields are lists of dependency specifications, with
each entry indicated a required dependency.

Conditional dependencies are lists of mappings with the following fields:

* ``dependencies``: a list of relevant dependency specifications
* ``extra``: the name of a set of optional dependencies that are requested
  and installed together. See `Extras (optional dependencies)`_ for details.
* ``environment``: an environment marker defining the environment that
  needs these dependencies. See `Environment markers`_ for details.

The ``dependencies`` field is required, as is at least one of ``extra`` and
``environment``. All three fields may be supplied, indicating that the
dependency is needed only when that particular set of additional
dependencies is requested in a particular environment.

Note that the same extras and environment markers MAY appear in multiple
conditional dependencies. This may happen, for example, if an extra itself
only needs some of its dependencies in specific environments.

.. note::

   Technically, you could store the conditional and unconditional
   dependencies in a single list and switch based on the entry type
   (string or mapping), but the ``*requires`` vs ``*may-require`` two
   list design seems easier to understand and work with.


Mapping dependencies to development and distribution activities
---------------------------------------------------------------

The different categories of dependency are based on the various distribution
and development activities identified above, and govern which dependencies
should be installed for the specified activities:

* Deployment dependencies:

    * ``requires``
    * ``may_require``
    * Request the ``test`` extra to also install

      * ``test_requires``
      * ``test_may_require``

* Build dependencies:

    * ``build_requires``
    * ``build_may_require``

* Development dependencies:

    * ``requires``
    * ``may_require``
    * ``build_requires``
    * ``build_may_require``
    * ``test_requires``
    * ``test_may_require``
    * ``dev_requires``
    * ``dev_may_require``

To ease compatibility with existing two phase setup/deployment toolchains,
installation tools MAY treat ``dev_requires`` and ``dev_may_require`` as
additions to ``build_requires`` and ``build_may_require`` rather than
as separate fields.

Installation tools SHOULD allow users to request at least the following
operations for a named distribution:

* Install the distribution and any deployment dependencies.
* Install just the build dependencies without installing the distribution
* Install just the development dependencies without installing
  the distribution

The notation described in `Extras (optional dependencies)`_ SHOULD be used to
request additional optional dependencies when installing deployment
or build dependencies.

Installation tools SHOULD report an error if dependencies cannot be found,
MUST at least emit a warning, and MAY allow the user to force the
installation to proceed regardless.

.. note::

    As an example of mapping this to Linux distro packages, assume an
    example project without any extras defined is split into 2 RPMs
    in a SPEC file: example and example-devel

    The ``requires`` and applicable ``may_require`` dependencies would be
    mapped to the Requires dependencies for the "example" RPM (a mapping from
    environment markers to SPEC file conditions would also allow those to
    be handled correctly)

    The ``build_requires`` and ``build_may_require`` dependencies would be
    mapped to the BuildRequires dependencies for the "example" RPM.

    All defined dependencies relevant to Linux, including those in
    ``dev_requires`` and ``test_requires``, would become Requires
    dependencies for the "example-devel" RPM.

    If a project defines any extras, those would be mapped to additional
    virtual RPMs with appropriate BuildRequires and Requires entries based
    on the details of the dependency specifications.

    A documentation toolchain dependency like Sphinx would either go in
    ``build_requires`` (for example, if man pages were included in the
    built distribution) or in ``dev_requires`` (for example, if the
    documentation is published solely through ReadTheDocs or the
    project website). This would be enough to allow an automated converter
    to map it to an appropriate dependency in the spec file.


Requires
--------

A list of other distributions needed when this distribution is deployed.

Example::

    "requires": ["SciPy", "PasteDeploy", "zope.interface (>3.5.0)"]


Extras
------

A list of optional sets of dependencies that may be used to define
conditional dependencies in ``"may_require"`` and similar fields. See
`Extras (optional dependencies)`_ for details.

The extra name``"test"`` is reserved for requesting the dependencies
specified in ``test_requires`` and ``test_may_require`` and is NOT
permitted in this field.

Example::

    "extras": ["warmup"]


May require
-----------

A list of other distributions that may be needed when this distribution
is deployed, based on the extras requested and the target deployment
environment.

Any extras referenced from this field MUST be named in the `Extras`_ field.

Example::

        "may_require": [
          {
            "dependencies": ["pywin32 (>1.0)"],
            "environment": "sys.platform == 'win32'"
          },
          {
            "dependencies": ["SoftCushions"],
            "extra": "warmup"
          }
        ]

Test requires
-------------

A list of other distributions needed in order to run the automated tests
for this distribution, either during development or when running the
``test_installed_dist`` metabuild when deployed.

Example::

    "test_requires": ["unittest2"]


Test may require
----------------

A list of other distributions that may be needed in order to run the
automated tests for this distribution, either during development or when
running the ``test_installed_dist`` metabuild when deployed, based on the
extras requested and the target deployment environment.

Any extras referenced from this field MUST be named in the `Extras`_ field.

Example::

        "test_may_require": [
          {
            "dependencies": ["pywin32 (>1.0)"],
            "environment": "sys.platform == 'win32'"
          },
          {
            "dependencies": ["CompressPadding"],
            "extra": "warmup"
          }
        ]


Build requires
--------------

A list of other distributions needed when this distribution is being built
(creating a binary archive from a source archive).

Note that while these are build dependencies for the distribution being
built, the installation is a *deployment* scenario for the dependencies.

Example::

    "build_requires": ["setuptools (>= 0.7)"]


Build may require
-----------------

A list of other distributions that may be needed when this distribution
is built (creating a binary archive from a source archive), based on the
features requested and the build environment.

Note that while these are build dependencies for the distribution being
built, the installation is a *deployment* scenario for the dependencies.

Any extras referenced from this field MUST be named in the `Extras`_ field.

Automated tools MAY assume that all extras are implicitly requested when
installing build dependencies.

Example::

        "build_may_require": [
          {
            "dependencies": ["pywin32 (>1.0)"],
            "environment": "sys.platform == 'win32'"
          },
          {
            "dependencies": ["cython"],
            "extra": "c-accelerators"
          }
        ]


Dev requires
------------

A list of any additional distributions needed during development of this
distribution that aren't already covered by the deployment and build
dependencies.

Additional dependencies that may be listed in this field include:

* tools needed to create a source archive
* tools needed to generate project documentation that is published online
  rather than distributed along with the rest of the software
* additional test dependencies for tests which are not executed when the
  test is invoked through the ``test_installed_dist`` metabuild hook (for
  example, tests that require a local database server and web server and
  may not work when fully installed on a production system)

Example::

    "dev_requires": ["hgtools", "sphinx (>= 1.0)"]


Dev may require
---------------

A list of other distributions that may be needed during development of
this distribution, based on the features requested and the build environment.

This should only be needed if the project's own utility scripts have
platform specific dependencies that aren't already defined as deployment
or build dependencies.

Any extras referenced from this field MUST be named in the `Extras`_ field.

Automated tools MAY assume that all extras are implicitly requested when
installing development dependencies.

Example::

        "dev_may_require": [
          {
            "dependencies": ["pywin32 (>1.0)"],
            "environment": "sys.platform == 'win32'"
          }
        ]


Provides
--------

A list of strings naming additional dependency requirements that are
satisfied by installing this distribution. These strings must be of the
form ``Name`` or ``Name (Version)``, as for the ``requires`` field.

While dependencies are usually resolved based on distribution names and
versions, a distribution may provide additional names explicitly in the
``provides`` field.

For example, this may be used to indicate that multiple projects have
been merged into and replaced by a single distribution or to indicate
that this project is a substitute for another.

For instance, with distribute merged back into setuptools, the merged
project is able to include a ``"provides": ["distribute"]`` entry to
satisfy any projects that require the now obsolete distribution's name.

A distribution may also provide a "virtual" project name, which does
not correspond to any separately distributed project:  such a name
might be used to indicate an abstract capability which could be supplied
by one of multiple projects.  For example, multiple projects might supply
PostgreSQL bindings for use with SQL Alchemy: each project might declare
that it provides ``sqlalchemy-postgresql-bindings``, allowing other
projects to depend only on having at least one of them installed.

A version declaration may be supplied and must follow the rules described
in PEP 440. The distribution's version identifier will be implied
if none is specified.

Example::

    "provides": ["AnotherProject (3.4)", "virtual_package"]


Obsoleted by
------------

A string that indicates that this project is no longer being developed.  The
named project provides a substitute or replacement.

A version declaration may be supplied and must follow the rules described
in PEP 440.

Possible uses for this field include handling project name changes and
project mergers.

For instance, with distribute merging back into setuptools, a new version
of distribute may be released that depends on the new version of setuptools,
and also explicitly indicates that distribute itself is now obsolete.

Note that without a corresponding ``provides``, there is no expectation
that the replacement project will be a "drop-in" replacement for the
obsolete project - at the very least, upgrading to the new distribution
is likely to require changes to import statements.

Examples::

    "name": "BadName",
    "obsoleted_by": "AcceptableName"

    "name": "distribute",
    "obsoleted_by": "setuptools (>= 0.7)"


Supports Environments
---------------------

A list of strings specifying the environments that the distribution
explicitly supports. An environment is considered supported if it
matches at least one of the environment markers given.

If this field is not given in the metadata, it is assumed that the
distribution supports any platform supported by Python.

Individual entries are environment markers, as described in
`Environment markers`_.

Installation tools SHOULD report an error if supported platforms are
specified by the distribution and the current platform fails to match
any of them, MUST at least emit a warning, and MAY allow the user to
force the installation to proceed regardless.

Examples::

   "supports_environments": ["sys_platform == 'win32'"]
   "supports_environments": ["sys_platform != 'win32'"]
   "supports_environments": ["'linux' in sys_platform",
                             "'bsd' in sys_platform"]


.. note::

   This field replaces the old Platform, Requires-Platform and
   Requires-Python fields and has been redesigned with environment
   marker based semantics that should make it possible to reliably flag,
   for example, Unix specific or Windows specific distributions, as well
   as Python 2 only and Python 3 only distributions.


Metabuild system
================

The ``metabuild_hooks`` field is used to define various operations that
may be invoked on a distribution in a platform independent manner.

The metabuild system currently defines three operations as part of the
deployment of a distribution:

* Installing to a deployment system
* Uninstalling from a deployment system
* Running the distribution's test suite on a deployment system (hence the
  ``test`` runtime extra)

Distributions may define handles for each of these operations as an
"entry point", a reference to a Python callable, with the module name
separated from the reference within the module by a colon (``:``).

Example metabuild hooks::

    "metabuild_hooks": {
        "postinstall": "myproject.build_hooks:postinstall",
        "preuininstall": "myproject.build_hooks:preuninstall",
        "test_installed_dist": "some_test_harness.metabuild_hook"
    }

Build and installation tools MAY offer additional operations beyond the
core metabuild operations. These operations SHOULD be composed from the
defined metabuild operations where appropriate.

Build and installation tools SHOULD support the legacy ``setup.py`` based
commands for metabuild operations not yet defined as metabuild hooks.

The metabuild hooks are gathered together into a single top level
``metabuild_hooks`` field. The individual hooks are:

* ``postinstall``: run after the distribution has been installed to a
  target deployment system (or after it has been upgraded). If the hook is
  not defined, it indicates no distribution specific actions are needed
  following installation.
* ``preuninstall``: run before the distribution has been uninstalled from a
  deployment system (or before it is upgraded). If the hook is not defined,
  it indicates no distribution specific actions are needed prior to
  uninstallation.
* ``test_installed_dist``: test an installed distribution is working. If the
  hook is not defined, it indicates the distribution does not support
  execution of the test suite after deployment.

The expected signatures of these hooks are as follows::

    def postinstall(current_meta, previous_meta=None):
        """Run following installation or upgrade of the distribution

        *current_meta* is the distribution metadata for the version now
        installed on the current system
        *previous_meta* is either missing or ``None`` (indicating a fresh
        install) or else the distribution metadata for the version that
        was previously installed (indicating an upgrade or downgrade).
        """

    def preuninstall(current_meta, next_meta=None):
        """Run prior to uninstallation or upgrade of the distribution

        *current_meta* is the distribution metadata for the version now
        installed on the current system
        *next_meta* is either missing or ``None`` (indicating complete
        uninstallation) or else the distribution metadata for the version
        that is about to be installed (indicating an upgrade or downgrade).
        """

    def test_installed_dist(current_meta):
        """Check an installed distribution is working correctly

        Note that this check should always be non-destructive as it may be
        invoked automatically by some tools.

        Requires that the distribution's test dependencies be installed
        (indicated by the ``test`` runtime extra).

        Returns ``True`` if the check passes, ``False`` otherwise.
        """

Metabuild hooks MUST be called with at least abbreviated metadata, and MAY
be called with full metadata.

Where necessary, metabuild hooks check for the presence or absence of
optional dependencies defined as extras using the same techniques used
during normal operation of the distribution (for example, checking for
import failures for optional dependencies).


Metadata Extensions
===================

Extensions to the metadata may be present in a mapping under the
'extensions' key.  The keys must meet the same restrictions as
distribution names, while the values may be any type natively supported
in JSON::

    "extensions" : {
        "chili" : { "type" : "Poblano", "heat" : "Mild" },
        "languages" : [ "French", "Italian", "Hebrew" ]
    }

To avoid name conflicts, it is recommended that distribution names be used
to identify metadata extensions. This practice will also make it easier to
find authoritative documentation for metadata extensions.


Extras (optional dependencies)
==============================

Extras are additional dependencies that enable an optional aspect
of the distribution, generally corresponding to a ``try: import
optional_dependency ...`` block in the code.  To support the use of the
distribution with or without the optional dependencies they are listed
separately from the distribution's core dependencies and must be requested
explicitly, either in the dependency specifications of another distribution,
or else when issuing a command to an installation tool.

The names of extras MUST abide by the same restrictions as those for
distribution names.

Example of a distribution with optional dependencies::

    "name": "ComfyChair",
    "extras": ["warmup", "c-accelerators"]
    "may_require": [
      {
        "dependencies": ["SoftCushions"],
        "extra": "warmup"
      }
    ]
    "build_may_require": [
      {
        "dependencies": ["cython"],
        "extra": "c-accelerators"
      }
    ]

Other distributions require the additional dependencies by placing the
relevant extra names inside square brackets after the distribution name when
specifying the dependency.

Extra specifications MUST support the following additional syntax:

* Multiple features can be requested by separating them with a comma within
  the brackets.
* All explicitly defined extras may be requested with the ``*`` wildcard
  character. Note that this does NOT request the implicitly defined
  ``test`` extra - that must always be requested explicitly when it is
  desired.
* Extras may be explicitly excluded by prefixing their name with a hyphen.

Command line based installation tools SHOULD support this same syntax to
allow extras to be requested explicitly.

The full set of dependency requirements is then based on the top level
dependencies, along with those of any requested extras.

Example::

    "requires": ["ComfyChair[warmup]"]
        -> requires ``ComfyChair`` and ``SoftCushions`` at run time

    "requires": ["ComfyChair[*]"]
        -> requires ``ComfyChair`` and ``SoftCushions`` at run time, but
           will also pick up any new optional dependencies other than those
           needed solely to run the tests


Environment markers
===================

An **environment marker** describes a condition about the current execution
environment. They are used to indicate when certain dependencies are only
required in particular environments, and to indicate supported platforms
for distributions with additional constraints beyond the availability of a
Python runtime.

Here are some examples of such markers::

   "sys_platform == 'win32'"
   "platform_machine == 'i386'"
   "python_version == '2.4' or python_version == '2.5'"
   "'linux' in sys_platform"

And here's an example of some conditional metadata for a distribution that
requires PyWin32 both at runtime and buildtime when using Windows::

    "name": "ComfyChair",
    "may_require": [
      {
        "dependencies": ["pywin32 (>1.0)"],
        "environment": "sys.platform == 'win32'"
      }
    ]
    "build_may_require": [
      {
        "dependencies": ["pywin32 (>1.0)"],
        "environment": "sys.platform == 'win32'"
      }
    ]

The micro-language behind this is a simple subset of Python: it compares
only strings, with the ``==`` and ``in`` operators (and their opposites),
and with the ability to combine expressions. Parentheses are supported
for grouping.

The pseudo-grammar is ::

    MARKER: EXPR [(and|or) EXPR]*
    EXPR: ("(" MARKER ")") | (SUBEXPR [(in|==|!=|not in) SUBEXPR])

where ``SUBEXPR`` is either a Python string (such as ``'2.4'``, or
``'win32'``) or one of the following marker variables:

* ``python_version``: ``'{0.major}.{0.minor}'.format(sys.version_info)``
* ``python_full_version``: see definition below
* ``os_name````: ``os.name``
* ``sys_platform````: ``sys.platform``
* ``platform_version``: ``platform.version()``
* ``platform_machine``: ``platform.machine()``
* ``platform_python_implementation``: ``platform.python_implementation()``

Note that all subexpressions are restricted to strings or one of the
marker variable names, meaning that it is not possible to use other
sequences like tuples or lists on the right side of the ``in`` and
``not in`` operators.

Unlike Python, chaining of comparison operations is NOT permitted in
environment markers.

The ``python_full_version`` marker variable is derived from
``sys.version_info()`` in accordance with the following algorithm::

    def format_full_version():
        info = sys.version_info
        version = '{0.major}.{0.minor}.{0.micro}'.format(info)
        kind = info.releaselevel
        if kind != 'final':
            version += kind[0] + str(info.serial)
        return version


Updating the metadata specification
===================================

The metadata specification may be updated with clarifications without
requiring a new PEP or a change to the metadata version.

Adding new features (other than through the extension mechanism), or
changing the meaning of existing fields, requires a new metadata version
defined in a new PEP.


Summary of differences from \PEP 345
====================================

* Metadata-Version is now 2.0, with semantics specified for handling
  version changes

* The increasingly complex ad hoc "Key: Value" format has been replaced by
  a more structured JSON compatible format that is easily represented as
  Python dictionaries, strings, lists.

* Most fields are now optional and filling in dummy data for omitted fields
  is explicitly disallowed

* Explicit permission for in-place clarifications without releasing a new
  version of the specification

* The PEP now attempts to provide more of an explanation of *why* the fields
  exist and how they are intended to be used, rather than being a simple
  description of the permitted contents

* Changed the version scheme to be based on PEP 440 rather than PEP 386

* Added the build label mechanism as described in PEP 440

* Support for different development, build, test and deployment dependencies

* The "Extras" optional dependency mechanism

* A well-defined metadata extension mechanism

* Metabuild hook system

* Clarify and simplify various aspects of environment markers:

  * allow use of parentheses for grouping in the pseudo-grammar
  * consistently use underscores instead of periods in the variable names
  * clarify that chained comparisons are not permitted

* More flexible system for defining contact points and contributors

* Defined a recommended set of project URLs

* New system for defining supported environments

* Updated obsolescence mechanism

* Added "License URL" field

* Explicit declaration of description markup format

* With all due respect to Charles Schulz and Peanuts, many of the examples
  have been updated to be more `thematically appropriate`_ for Python ;)

The rationale for major changes is given in the following sections.


Metadata-Version semantics
--------------------------

The semantics of major and minor version increments are now specified,
and follow the same model as the format version semantics specified for
the wheel format in PEP 427: minor version increments must behave
reasonably when processed by a tool that only understand earlier metadata
versions with the same major version, while major version increments
may include changes that are not compatible with existing tools.

The major version number of the specification has been incremented
accordingly, as interpreting PEP 426 metadata obviously cannot be
interpreted in accordance with earlier metadata specifications.

Whenever the major version number of the specification is incremented, it
is expected that deployment will take some time, as either metadata
consuming tools must be updated before other tools can safely start
producing the new format, or else the sdist and wheel formats, along with
the installation database definition, will need to be updated to support
provision of multiple versions of the metadata in parallel.

Existing tools won't abide by this guideline until they're updated to
support the new metadata standard, so the new semantics will first take
effect for a hypothetical 2.x -> 3.0 transition. For the 1.x -> 2.0
transition, we will use the approach where tools continue to produce the
existing supplementary files (such as ``entry_points.txt``) in addition
to any equivalents specified using the new features of the standard
metadata format (including the formal extension mechanism).


Switching to a JSON compatible format
-------------------------------------

The old "Key:Value" format was becoming increasingly limiting, with various
complexities like parsers needing to know which fields were permitted to
occur more than once, which fields supported the environment marker
syntax (with an optional ``";"`` to separate the value from the marker) and
eventually even the option to embed arbitrary JSON inside particular
subfields.

The old serialisation format also wasn't amenable to easy conversion to
standard Python data structures for use in the new metabuild hook APIs, or
in future extensions to the importer APIs to allow them to provide
information for inclusion in the installation database.

Accordingly, we've taken the step of switching to a JSON-compatible metadata
format. This works better for APIs and is much easier for tools to parse and
generate correctly. Changing the name of the metadata file also makes it
easy to distribute 1.x and 2.x metadata in parallel, greatly simplifying
several aspects of the migration to the new metadata format.


Changing the version scheme
---------------------------

See PEP 440 for a detailed rationale for the various changes made to the
versioning scheme.


Build labels
------------

See PEP 440 for the rationale behind the addition of this field.


Development, build and deployment dependencies
----------------------------------------------

The separation of the ``requires``, ``build_requires`` and ``dev_requires``
fields allow a distribution to indicate whether a dependency is needed
specifically to develop, build or deploy the distribution.

As distribution metadata improves, this should allow much greater control
over where particular dependencies end up being installed .


Support for optional dependencies for distributions
---------------------------------------------------

The new extras system allows distributions to declare optional
features, and to use the ``may_require`` and ``build_may_require`` fields
to indicate when particular dependencies are needed only to support those
features. It is derived from the equivalent system that is already in
widespread use as part of ``setuptools`` and allows that aspect of the
legacy ``setuptools`` metadata to be accurately represented in the new
metadata format.

The ``test`` extra is implicitly defined for all distributions, as it
ties in with the new metabuild hook offering a standard way to request
execution of a distribution's test suite. Identifying test suite
dependencies is already one of the most popular uses of the extras system
in ``setuptools``.


Support for metadata extensions
-------------------------------

The new extension effectively allows sections of the metadata
namespace to be delegated to other distributions, while preserving a
standard overal format metadata format for easy of processing by
distribution tools that do not support a particular extension.

It also works well in combination with the new ``build_requires`` field
to allow a distribution to depend on tools which *do* know how to handle
the chosen extension, and the new extras mechanism, allowing support for
particular extensions to be provided as optional features.


Support for metabuild hooks
---------------------------

The new metabuild system is designed to allow the wheel format to fully
replace direct installation on deployment targets, by allows projects like
Twisted to still execute code following installation from a wheel file.

Falling back to invoking ``setup.py`` directly rather than using a
metabuild hook will remain an option when relying on version 1.x metadata,
and is also used as the interim solution for installation from source
archives.

The ``test_installed_dist`` metabuild hook is included as a complement to
the ability to explicitly specify test dependencies.


Changes to environment markers
------------------------------

The changes to environment markers were just clarifications and
simplifications to make them easier to use.

The arbitrariness of the choice of ``.`` and ``_`` in the different
variables was addressed by standardising on ``_`` (as these are predefined
variables rather than live references into the Python module namespace)

The use of parentheses for grouping and the disallowance of chained
comparisons were added to address some underspecified behaviour in the
previous version of the specification.


Updated contact information
---------------------------

The switch to JSON made it possible to provide a more flexible
system for defining multiple contact points for a project, as well as
listing other contributors.

The ``type`` concept allows for preservation of the distinction between
the original author of a project, and a lead maintainer that takes over
at a later date.


Changes to project URLs
-----------------------

In addition to allow arbitrary strings as project URL labels, the new
metadata standard also defines a recommend set of four URL labels for
a distribution's home page, documentation, source control and issue tracker.


Changes to platform support
---------------------------

The new environment marker system makes it possible to define supported
platforms in a way that is actually amenable to automated processing. This
has been used to replace several older fields with poorly defined semantics.

For the moment, the old ``Requires-External`` field has been removed
entirely. Possible replacements may be explored through the metadata
extension mechanism.


Updated obsolescence mechanism
------------------------------

The marker to indicate when a project is obsolete and should be replaced
has been moved to the obsolete project (the new ``obsoleted_by`` field),
replacing the previous marker on the replacement project (the removed
``Obsoletes-Dist`` field).

This should allow distribution tools to more easily warn users of
obsolete projects and their suggested replacements.

The ``Obsoletes-Dist`` header is removed rather than deprecated as it
is not widely supported, and so removing it does not present any significant
barrier to tools and projects adopting the new metadata format.

Explicit markup for description
-------------------------------

Currently, PyPI attempts to detect the markup format by rendering it as
reStructuredText, and if that fails, treating it as plain text. Allowing
the intended format to be stated explicitly will allow this guessing to be
removed, and more informative error reports to be provided to users when
a rendering error occurs.

This is especially necessary since PyPI applies additional restrictions to
the rendering process for security reasons, thus a description that renders
correctly on a developer's system may still fail to render on the server.


Deferred features
=================

Several potentially useful features have been deliberately deferred in
order to better prioritise our efforts in migrating to the new metadata
standard. These all reflect information that may be nice to have in the
new metadata, but which can be readily added in metadata 2.1 without
breaking any use cases already supported by metadata 2.0.

Once the ``pypi``, ``setuptools``, ``pip`` and ``distlib`` projects
support creation and consumption of metadata 2.0, then we may revisit
the creation of metadata 2.1 with these additional features.

.. note::

   Given the nature of this PEP as an interoperability specification,
   this section will probably be removed before the PEP is accepted.
   However, it's useful to have it here while discussion is ongoing.


String methods in environment markers
-------------------------------------

Supporting at least ".startswith" and ".endswith" string methods in
environment markers would allow some conditions to be written more
naturally. For example, ``"sys.platform.startswith('win')"`` is a
somewhat more intuitive way to mark Windows specific dependencies,
since ``"'win' in sys.platform"`` is incorrect thanks to ``cygwin``
and the  fact that 64-bit Windows still shows up as ``win32`` is more
than a little strange.


Module listing
--------------

A top level ``"module"`` key, referencing a list of strings, with each
giving the fully qualified name of a public package or module provided
by the distribution.

A flat list would be used in order to correctly accommodate namespace
packages (where a distribution may provide subpackages or submodules without
explicitly providing the parent namespace package).

Example::

    "modules": [
        "comfy.chair"
    ]

Explicitly providing a list of public module names will likely help
with enabling features in RPM like "Requires: python(requests)", as well
as providing richer static metadata for analysis from PyPI.

However, this is just extra info that doesn't impact installing from wheels,
so it is a good candidate for postponing to metadata 2.1.


Additional metabuild hooks
--------------------------

The following draft metabuild operations have been deferred for now:

* Generating the metadata file on a development system
* Generating a source archive on a development system
* Generating a binary archive on a build system

Metadata 2.0 deliberately focuses on wheel based installation, leaving
tarball and sdist based installation to use the existing ``setup.py``
based ``distutils`` command interface.

In the meantime, the above four operations will continue to be handled
through the ``distutils``/``setuptools`` command system:

* ``python setup.py dist_info``
* ``python setup.py sdist``
* ``python setup.py bdist_wheel``

The following additional metabuild hooks may be added in metadata 2.1 to
cover these operations without relying on ``setup.py``:

* ``make_dist_info``: generate the source archive's dist_info directory
* ``make_sdist``: construct a source archive
* ``build_wheel``: construct a binary wheel archive from an sdist source
  archive

Tentative signatures have been designed for those hooks, but they will
not be pursued further until 2.1 (note that the current signatures for
the hooks do *not* adequately handle the "extras" concept)::

    def make_dist_info(source_dir, info_dir):
        """Generate the contents of dist_info for an sdist archive

        *source_dir* points to a source checkout or unpacked tarball
        *info_dir* is the destination where the sdist metadata files should
        be written

        Returns the distribution metadata as a dictionary.
        """

    def make_sdist(source_dir, contents_dir, info_dir):
        """Generate the contents of an sdist archive

        *source_dir* points to a source checkout or unpacked tarball
        *contents_dir* is the destination where the sdist contents should be
        written (note that archiving the contents is the responsibility of
        the metabuild tool rather than the hook function)
        *info_dir* is the destination where the sdist metadata files should
        be written

        Returns the distribution metadata as a dictionary.
        """

    def build_wheel(sdist_dir, contents_dir, info_dir, compatibility=None):
        """Generate the contents of a wheel archive

        *source_dir* points to an unpacked source archive
        *contents_dir* is the destination where the wheel contents should be
        written (note that archiving the contents is the responsibility of
        the metabuild tool rather than the hook function)
        *info_dir* is the destination where the wheel metadata files should
        be written
        *compatibility* is an optional PEP 425 compatibility tag indicating
        the desired target compatibility for the build. If the tag cannot
        be satisfied, the hook should throw ``ValueError``.

        Returns the actual compatibility tag for the build
        """


Rejected Features
=================

The following features have been explicitly considered and rejected as
introducing too much additional complexity for too small a gain in
expressiveness.

.. note::

   Given the nature of this PEP as an interoperability specification,
   this section will probably be removed before the PEP is accepted.
   However, it's useful to have it here while discussion is ongoing.


Detached metadata
-----------------

Rather than allowing some large items (such as the description field) to
be distributed separately, this PEP instead defines two metadata subsets
that should support more reasonable caching and API designs (for example,
only the essential dependency resolution metadata would be distributed
through TUF, and it is entirely possible the updated sdist, wheel and
installation database specs will use the abbreviated metadata, leaving
the full metadata as the province of index servers).


Alternative dependencies
------------------------

An earlier draft of this PEP considered allowing lists in place of the
usual strings in dependency specifications to indicate that there aren
multiple ways to satisfy a dependency.

If at least one of the individual dependencies was already available, then
the entire dependency would be considered satisfied, otherwise the first
entry would be added to the dependency set.

Alternative dependency specification example::

   ["Pillow", "PIL"]
   ["mysql", "psycopg2 (>= 4)", "sqlite3"]

However, neither of the given examples is particularly compelling,
since Pillow/PIL style forks aren't common, and the database driver use
case would arguably be better served by an SQL Alchemy defined "supported
database driver" metadata extension where a project depends on SQL Alchemy,
and then declares in the extension which database drivers are checked for
compatibility by the upstream project (similar to the advisory
``supports-platform`` field in the main metadata).

We're also getting better support for "virtual provides" in this version of
the metadata standard, so this may end up being an installer and index
server problem to better track and publish those.


Compatible release comparisons in environment markers
-----------------------------------------------------

PEP 440 defines a rich syntax for version comparisons that could
potentially be useful with ``python_version`` and ``python_full_version``
in environment markers. However, allowing the full syntax would mean
environment markers are no longer a Python subset, while allowing
only some of the comparisons would introduce yet another special case
to handle.

Given that environment markers are only used in cases where a higher level
"or" is implied by the metadata structure, it seems easier to require the
use of multiple comparisons against specific Python versions for the rare
cases where this would be useful.


Conditional provides
--------------------

Under the revised metadata design, conditional "provides" based on runtime
features or the environment would go in a separate "may_provide" field.
However, I'm not convinced there's a great use case for that, so the idea
is rejected unless someone can present a compelling use case (and even then
the idea wouldn't be reconsidered until metadata 2.1 at the earliest).
