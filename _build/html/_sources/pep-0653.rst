Abstract
========

This PEP proposes a semantics for pattern matching that respects the general concept of PEP 634,
but is more precise, easier to reason about, and should be faster.

The object model will be extended with two special (dunder) attributes, ``__match_container__`` and
``__match_class__``, in addition to the ``__match_args__`` attribute from PEP 634, to support pattern matching.
Both of these new attributes must be integers and ``__match_args__`` is required to be a tuple of unique strings.

With this PEP:

* The semantics of pattern matching will be clearer, so that patterns are easier to reason about.
* It will be possible to implement pattern matching in a more efficient fashion.
* Pattern matching will be more usable for complex classes, by allowing classes some more control over which patterns they match.

Motivation
==========

Pattern matching in Python, as described in PEP 634, is to be added to Python 3.10.
Unfortunately, PEP 634 is not as precise about the semantics as it could be,
nor does it allow classes sufficient control over how they match patterns.

Precise semantics
-----------------

PEP 634 explicitly includes a section on undefined behavior.
Large amounts of undefined behavior may be acceptable in a language like C,
but in Python it should be kept to a minimum.
Pattern matching in Python can be defined more precisely without losing expressiveness or performance.

Improved control over class matching
------------------------------------

PEP 634 delegates the decision over whether a class is a sequence or mapping to ``collections.abc``.
Not all classes that could be considered sequences are registered as subclasses of ``collections.abc.Sequence``.
This PEP allows them to match sequence patterns, without the full ``collections.abc.Sequence`` machinery.

PEP 634 privileges some builtin classes with a special form of matching, the "self" match.
For example the pattern ``list(x)`` matches a list and assigns the list to ``x``.
By allowing classes to choose which kinds of pattern they match, other classes can use this form as well.

For example, using ``sympy``, we might want to write::

    # a*a == a**2
    case Mul(args=[Symbol(a), Symbol(b)]) if a == b:
        return Pow(a, 2)

Which requires the sympy class ``Symbol`` to "self" match.
For ``sympy`` to support this pattern with PEP 634 is possible, but a bit tricky.
With this PEP it can be implemented very easily [1]_.

Robustness
----------

With this PEP, access to attributes during pattern matching becomes well defined and deterministic.
This makes pattern matching less error prone when matching objects with hidden side effects, such as object-relational mappers.
Objects will have more control over their own deconstruction, which can help prevent unintended consequences should attribute access have side-effects.

PEP 634 relies on the ``collections.abc`` module when determining which patterns a value can match, implicitly importing it if necessary.
This PEP will eliminate surprising import errors and misleading audit events from those imports.


Efficient implementation
------------------------

The semantics proposed in this PEP will allow efficient implementation, partly as a result of having precise semantics
and partly from using the object model.

With precise semantics, it is possible to reason about what code transformations are correct,
and thus apply optimizations effectively.

Because the object model is a core part of Python, implementations already handle special attribute lookup efficiently.
Looking up a special attribute is much faster than performing a subclass test on an abstract base class.

Rationale
=========

The object model and special methods are at the core of the Python language. Consequently, 
implementations support them well.
Using special attributes for pattern matching allows pattern matching to be implemented in a way that
integrates well with the rest of the implementation, and is thus easier to maintain and is likely to perform better.

A match statement performs a sequence of pattern matches. In general, matching a pattern has three parts:

1. Can the value match this kind of pattern?
2. When deconstructed, does the value match this particular pattern?
3. Is the guard true?

To determine whether a value can match a particular kind of pattern, we add the ``__match_container__``
and ``__match_class__`` attributes.
This allows the kind of a value to be determined in a efficient fashion.

Specification
=============

Additions to the object model
-----------------------------

The ``__match_container__ ``and ``__match_class__`` attributes will be added to ``object``.
``__match_container__`` should be overridden by classes that want to match mapping or sequence patterns.
``__match_class__`` should be overridden by classes that want to change the default behavior when matching class patterns.

``__match_container__`` must be an integer and should be exactly one of these::

  0
  MATCH_SEQUENCE = 1
  MATCH_MAPPING = 2

``MATCH_SEQUENCE`` is used to indicate that instances of the class can match sequence patterns.

``MATCH_MAPPING`` is used to indicate that instances of the class can match mapping patterns.

``__match_class__`` must be an integer and should be exactly one of these::

  0
  MATCH_SELF = 8

``MATCH_SELF`` is used to indicate that for a single positional argument class pattern, the subject will be used and not deconstructed.

.. note::
    In the rest of this document, we will refer to the above values by name only.
    Symbolic constants will be provided both for Python and C, and the values will
    never be changed.

``object`` will have the following values for the special attributes::

  __match_container__ = 0
  __match_class__= 0
  __match_args__ = ()

These special attributes will be inherited as normal.

If ``__match_args__`` is overridden, then it is required to hold a tuple of unique strings. It may be empty.

.. note::
    ``__match_args__`` will be automatically generated for dataclasses and named tuples, as specified in PEP 634.

The pattern matching implementation is *not* required to check that any of these attributes behave as specified.
If the value of ``__match_container__``, ``__match_class__`` or ``__match_args__`` is not as specified, then
the implementation may raise any exception, or match the wrong pattern.
Of course, implementations are free to check these properties and provide meaningful error messages if they can do so efficiently.

Semantics of the matching process
---------------------------------

In the following, all variables of the form ``$var`` are temporary variables and are not visible to the Python program.
They may be visible via introspection, but that is an implementation detail and should not be relied on.
The psuedo-statement ``FAIL`` is used to signify that matching failed for this pattern and that matching should move to the next pattern.
If control reaches the end of the translation without reaching a ``FAIL``, then it has matched, and following patterns are ignored.

Variables of the form ``$ALL_CAPS`` are meta-variables holding a syntactic element, they are not normal variables.
So, ``$VARS = $items`` is not an assignment of ``$items`` to ``$VARS``,
but an unpacking of ``$items`` into the variables that ``$VARS`` holds.
For example, with the abstract syntax ``case [$VARS]:``, and the concrete syntax ``case[a, b]:`` then ``$VARS`` would hold the variables ``(a, b)``,
not the values of those variables.

The psuedo-function ``QUOTE`` takes a variable and returns the name of that variable.
For example, if the meta-variable ``$VAR`` held the variable ``foo`` then ``QUOTE($VAR) == "foo"``.

All additional code listed below that is not present in the original source will not trigger line events, conforming to PEP 626.


Preamble
''''''''

Before any patterns are matched, the expression being matched is evaluated::

    match expr:

translates to::

    $value = expr

Capture patterns
''''''''''''''''

Capture patterns always match, so the irrefutable match::

    case capture_var:

translates to::

    capture_var = $value

Wildcard patterns
'''''''''''''''''

Wildcard patterns always match, so::

    case _:

translates to::

    # No code -- Automatically matches


Literal Patterns
''''''''''''''''

The literal pattern::

    case LITERAL:

translates to::

    if $value != LITERAL:
        FAIL

except when the literal is one of ``None``, ``True`` or ``False`` ,
when it translates to::

    if $value is not LITERAL:
        FAIL

Value Patterns
''''''''''''''

The value pattern::

    case value.pattern:

translates to::

    if $value != value.pattern:
        FAIL

Sequence Patterns
'''''''''''''''''

A pattern not including a star pattern::

    case [$VARS]:

translates to::

    $kind = type($value).__match_container__
    if $kind != MATCH_SEQUENCE:
        FAIL
    if len($value) != len($VARS):
        FAIL
    $VARS = $value

Example: [2]_

A pattern including a star pattern::

    case [$VARS]

translates to::

    $kind = type($value).__match_container__
    if $kind != MATCH_SEQUENCE:
        FAIL
    if len($value) < len($VARS):
        FAIL
    $VARS = $value # Note that $VARS includes a star expression.

Example: [3]_

Mapping Patterns
''''''''''''''''

A pattern not including a double-star pattern::

    case {$KEYWORD_PATTERNS}:

translates to::

    $sentinel = object()
    $kind = type($value).__match_container__
    if $kind != MATCH_MAPPING:
        FAIL
    # $KEYWORD_PATTERNS is a meta-variable mapping names to variables.
    for $KEYWORD in $KEYWORD_PATTERNS:
        $tmp = $value.get(QUOTE($KEYWORD), $sentinel)
        if $tmp is $sentinel:
            FAIL
        $KEYWORD_PATTERNS[$KEYWORD] = $tmp

Example: [4]_

A pattern including a double-star pattern::

    case {$KEYWORD_PATTERNS, **$DOUBLE_STARRED_PATTERN}:

translates to::

    $kind = type($value).__match_container__
    if $kind != MATCH_MAPPING:
        FAIL
    # $KEYWORD_PATTERNS is a meta-variable mapping names to variables.
    $tmp = dict($value)
    if not $tmp.keys() >= $KEYWORD_PATTERNS.keys():
        FAIL:
    for $KEYWORD in $KEYWORD_PATTERNS:
        $KEYWORD_PATTERNS[$KEYWORD] = $tmp.pop(QUOTE($KEYWORD))
    $DOUBLE_STARRED_PATTERN = $tmp

Example: [5]_

Class Patterns
''''''''''''''

Class pattern with no arguments::

    case ClsName():

translates to::

    if not isinstance($value, ClsName):
        FAIL

Class pattern with a single positional pattern::

    case ClsName($VAR):

translates to::

    $kind = type($value).__match_class__
    if $kind == MATCH_SELF:
        if not isinstance($value, ClsName):
            FAIL
        $VAR = $value
    else:
        As other positional-only class pattern


Positional-only class pattern::

    case ClsName($VARS):

translates to::

    if not isinstance($value, ClsName):
        FAIL
    $attrs = ClsName.__match_args__
    if len($attr) < len($VARS):
        raise TypeError(...)
    try:
        for i, $VAR in enumerate($VARS):
            $VAR = getattr($value, $attrs[i])
    except AttributeError:
        FAIL

Example: [6]_

Class patterns with all keyword patterns::

    case ClsName($KEYWORD_PATTERNS):

translates to::

    if not isinstance($value, ClsName):
        FAIL
    try:
        for $KEYWORD in $KEYWORD_PATTERNS:
            $tmp = getattr($value, QUOTE($KEYWORD))
            $KEYWORD_PATTERNS[$KEYWORD] = $tmp
    except AttributeError:
        FAIL

Example: [7]_

Class patterns with positional and keyword patterns::

    case ClsName($VARS, $KEYWORD_PATTERNS):

translates to::

    if not isinstance($value, ClsName):
        FAIL
    $attrs = ClsName.__match_args__
    if len($attr) < len($VARS):
        raise TypeError(...)
    $pos_attrs = $attrs[:len($VARS)]
    try:
        for i, $VAR in enumerate($VARS):
            $VAR = getattr($value, $attrs[i])
        for $KEYWORD in $KEYWORD_PATTERNS:
            $name = QUOTE($KEYWORD)
            if $name in pos_attrs:
                raise TypeError(...)
            $KEYWORD_PATTERNS[$KEYWORD] = getattr($value, $name)
    except AttributeError:
        FAIL

Example: [8]_


Nested patterns
'''''''''''''''

The above specification assumes that patterns are not nested. For nested patterns
the above translations are applied recursively by introducing temporary capture patterns.

For example, the pattern::

    case [int(), str()]:

translates to::

    $kind = type($value).__match_class__
    if $kind != MATCH_SEQUENCE:
        FAIL
    if len($value) != 2:
        FAIL
    $value_0, $value_1 = $value
    #Now match on temporary values
    if not isinstance($value_0, int):
        FAIL
    if not isinstance($value_1, str):
        FAIL

Guards
''''''

Guards translate to a test following the rest of the translation::

    case pattern if guard:

translates to::

    [translation for pattern]
    if not guard:
        FAIL


Non-conforming special attributes
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

All classes should ensure that the the values of ``__match_container__``, ``__match_class__``
and ``__match_args__`` follow the specification.
Therefore, implementations can assume, without checking, that the following are true::

    __match_container__ == 0 or __match_container__ == MATCH_SEQUENCE or __match_container__ == MATCH_MAPPING
    __match_class__ == 0 or __match_class__ == MATCH_SELF

and that ``__match_args__`` is a tuple of unique strings.

Values of the special attributes for classes in the standard library
--------------------------------------------------------------------

For the core builtin container classes ``__match_container__`` will be:

* ``list``: ``MATCH_SEQUENCE``
* ``tuple``: ``MATCH_SEQUENCE``
* ``dict``: ``MATCH_MAPPING``
* ``bytearray``: 0
* ``bytes``: 0
* ``str``: 0

Named tuples will have ``__match_container__`` set to ``MATCH_SEQUENCE``.

* All other standard library classes for which ``issubclass(cls, collections.abc.Mapping)`` is true will have ``__match_container__`` set to ``MATCH_MAPPING``.
* All other standard library classes for which ``issubclass(cls, collections.abc.Sequence)`` is true will have ``__match_container__`` set to ``MATCH_SEQUENCE``.

For the following builtin classes ``__match_class__`` will be set to ``MATCH_SELF``:

* ``bool``
* ``bytearray``
* ``bytes``
* ``float``
* ``frozenset``
* ``int``
* ``set``
* ``str``
* ``list``
* ``tuple``
* ``dict``

Legal optimizations
-------------------

The above semantics implies a lot of redundant effort and copying in the implementation.
However, it is possible to implement the above semantics efficiently by employing semantic preserving transformations
on the naive implementation.

When performing matching, implementations are allowed
to treat the following functions and methods as pure:

For any class supporting ``MATCH_SEQUENCE``::

* ``cls.__len__()``
* ``cls.__getitem__()``

For any class supporting ``MATCH_MAPPING``::

* ``cls.get()`` (Two argument form only)

Implementations are allowed to make the following assumptions:

* ``isinstance(obj, cls)`` can be freely replaced with ``issubclass(type(obj), cls)`` and vice-versa.
* ``isinstance(obj, cls)`` will always return the same result for any ``(obj, cls)`` pair and repeated calls can thus be elided.
* Reading any of ``__match_container__``, ``__match_class__`` or ``__match_args__`` is a pure operation, and may be cached.
* Sequences, that is any class for which ``__match_container__ == MATCH_SEQUENCE`` is not zero, are not modified by iteration, subscripting or calls to ``len()``.
  Consequently, those operations can be freely substituted for each other where they would be equivalent when applied to an immutable sequence.
* Mappings, that is any class for which ``__match_container__ == MATCH_MAPPING`` is not zero, will not capture the second argument of the ``get()`` method.
  So, the ``$sentinel`` value may be freely re-used.

In fact, implementations are encouraged to make these assumptions, as it is likely to result in significantly better performance.


Security Implications
=====================

None.

Implementation
==============

The naive implementation that follows from the specification will not be very efficient.
Fortunately, there are some reasonably straightforward transformations that can be used to improve performance.
Performance should be comparable to the implementation of PEP 634 (at time of writing) by the release of 3.10.
Further performance improvements may have to wait for the 3.11 release.

Possible optimizations
----------------------

The following is not part of the specification,
but guidelines to help developers create an efficient implementation.

Splitting evaluation into lanes
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Since the first step in matching each pattern is check to against the kind, it is possible to combine all the checks against kind into a single multi-way branch at the beginning
of the match. The list of cases can then be duplicated into several "lanes" each corresponding to one kind.
It is then trivial to remove unmatchable cases from each lane.
Depending on the kind, different optimization strategies are possible for each lane.
Note that the body of the match clause does not need to be duplicated, just the pattern.

Sequence patterns
'''''''''''''''''

This is probably the most complex to optimize and the most profitable in terms of performance.
Since each pattern can only match a range of lengths, often only a single length,
the sequence of tests can be rewritten in as an explicit iteration over the sequence,
attempting to match only those patterns that apply to that sequence length.

For example:

::

    case []:
        A
    case [x]:
        B
    case [x, y]:
        C
    case other:
        D

Can be compiled roughly as:

::

    # Choose lane
    $i = iter($value)
    for $0 in $i:
        break
    else:
        A
        goto done
    for $1 in $i:
        break
    else:
        x = $0
        B
        goto done
    for $2 in $i:
        del $0, $1, $2
        break
    else:
        x = $0
        y = $1
        C
        goto done
    other = $value
    D
  done:


Mapping patterns
''''''''''''''''

The best stategy here is probably to form a decision tree based on the size of the mapping and which keys are present.
There is no point repeatedly testing for the presence of a key.
For example::

    match obj:
        case {a:x, b:y}:
            W
        case {a:x, c:y}:
            X
        case {a:x, b:_, c:y}:
            Y
        case other:
            Z

If the key ``"a"`` is not present when checking for case X, there is no need to check it again for Y.

The mapping lane can be implemented, roughly as:

::

    # Choose lane
    if len($value) == 2:
        if "a" in $value:
            if "b" in $value:
                x = $value["a"]
                y = $value["b"]
                goto W
            if "c" in $value:
                x = $value["a"]
                y = $value["c"]
                goto X
    elif len($value) == 3:
        if "a" in $value and "b" in $value:
            x = $value["a"]
            y = $value["c"]
            goto Y
    other = $value
    goto Z

Summary of differences between this PEP and PEP 634
===================================================


The changes to the semantics can be summarized as:

* Requires ``__match_args__`` to be a *tuple* of strings, not just a sequence.
  This make pattern matching a bit more robust and optimizable as ``__match_args__`` can be assumed to be immutable.
* Selecting the kind of container patterns that can be matched uses ``cls.__match_container__`` instead of
  ``issubclass(cls, collections.abc.Mapping)`` and ``issubclass(cls, collections.abc.Sequence)``.
* Allows classes to opt out of deconstruction altogether, if necessary, but setting ``__match_class__ = 0``.
* The behavior when matching patterns is more precisely defined, but is otherwise unchanged.

There are no changes to syntax. All examples given in the PEP 636 tutorial should continue to work as they do now.

Rejected Ideas
==============

Using attributes from the instance's dictionary
-----------------------------------------------

An earlier version of this PEP only used attributes from the instance's dictionary when matching a class pattern with ``__match_class__`` was the default value.
The intent was to avoid capturing bound-methods and other synthetic attributes. However, this also mean that properties were ignored.

For the class::

    class C:
        def __init__(self):
            self.a = "a"
        @property
        def p(self):
            ...
        def m(self):
            ...

Ideally we would match the attributes "a" and "p", but not "m".
However, there is no general way to do that, so this PEP now follows the semantics of PEP 634.

Lookup of ``__match_args__`` on the subject not the pattern
-----------------------------------------------------------

An earlier version of this PEP looked up ``__match_args__`` on the class of the subject and
not the class specified in the pattern.
This has been rejected for a few reasons::

* Using the class specified in the pattern is more amenable to optimization and can offer better performance.
* Using the class specified in the pattern has the potential to provide better error reporting is some cases.
* Neither approach is perfect, both have odd corner cases. Keeping the status quo minimizes disruption.

Combining ``__match_class__`` and ``__match_container__`` into a single value
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

An earlier version of this PEP combined ``__match_class__`` and ``__match_container__`` into a single value, ``__match_kind__``.
Using a single value has a small advantage in terms of performance,
but is likely to result in unintended changes to container matching when overriding class matching behavior, and vice versa.


Deferred Ideas
==============

The original version of this PEP included the match kind ``MATCH_POSITIONAL`` and special method
``__deconstruct__`` which would allow classes full control over their matching. This is important
for libraries like ``sympy``.

For example, using ``sympy``, we might want to write::

    # sin(x)**2 + cos(x)**2 == 1
    case Add(Pow(sin(a), 2), Pow(cos(b), 2)) if a == b:
        return 1

For ``sympy`` to support the positional patterns with current pattern matching is possible,
but is tricky. With these additional features it can be implemented easily [9]_.

This idea will feature in a future PEP for 3.11.
However, it is too late in the 3.10 development cycle for such a change.

Having a separate value to reject all class matches
---------------------------------------------------

In an earlier version of this PEP, there was a distinct value for ``__match_class__`` that allowed classes to not match any class
pattern that would have required deconstruction. However, this would become redundant once ``MATCH_POSITIONAL`` is introduced, and
complicates the specification for an extremely rare case.
