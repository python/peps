Abstract
========

This PEP proposes adding a new built-in function called ``noop()`` which does
nothing but return ``None``.


Rationale
=========

It is trivial to implement a no-op function in Python.  It's so easy in fact
that many people do it many times over and over again.  It would be useful in
many cases to have a common built-in function that does nothing.

One use case would be for PEP 553, where you could set the breakpoint
environment variable to the following in order to effectively disable it::

    $ setenv PYTHONBREAKPOINT=noop


Implementation
==============

The Python equivalent of the ``noop()`` function is exactly::

    def noop(*args, **kws):
        return None

The C built-in implementation is available as a pull request [1]_.


Rejected alternatives
=====================

``noop()`` returns something
----------------------------

YAGNI.

This is rejected because it complicates the semantics.  For example, if you
always return both ``*args`` and ``**kws``, what do you return when none of
those are given?  Returning a tuple of ``((), {})`` is kind of ugly, but
provides consistency.  But you might also want to just return ``None`` since
that's also conceptually what the function was passed.

Or, what if you pass in exactly one positional argument, e.g. ``noop(7)``.  Do
you return ``7`` or ``((7,), {})``?  And so on.

The author claims that you won't ever need the return value of ``noop()`` so
it will always return ``None``.

Coghlan's Dialogs (edited for formatting):

    My counterargument to this would be ``map(noop, iterable)``,
    ``sorted(iterable, key=noop)``, etc. (``filter``, ``max``, and
    ``min`` all accept callables that accept a single argument, as do
    many of the itertools operations).

    Making ``noop()`` a useful default function in those cases just
    needs the definition to be::

       def noop(*args, **kwds):
           return args[0] if args else None

    The counterargument to the counterargument is that using ``None``
    as the default in all these cases is going to be faster, since it
    lets the algorithm skip the callback entirely, rather than calling
    it and having it do nothing useful.
