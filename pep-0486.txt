Abstract
========

The Windows installers for Python include a launcher that locates the
correct Python interpreter to run (see PEP 397).  However, the
launcher is not aware of virtual environments (virtualenv [1]_ or PEP
405 based), and so cannot be used to run commands from the active
virtualenv.

This PEP proposes making the launcher "virtualenv aware".  This means
that when run without specifying an explicit Python interpreter to
use, the launcher will use the currently active virtualenv, if any,
before falling back to the configured default Python.


Rationale
=========

Windows users with multiple copies of Python installed need a means of
selecting which one to use.  The Python launcher provides this
facility by means of a ``py`` command that can be used to run either a
configured "default" Python or a specific interpreter, by means of
command line arguments.  So typical usage would be::

    # Run the Python interactive interpreter
    py

    # Execute an installed module
    py -m pip install pytest
    py -m pytest

When using virtual environments, the ``py`` launcher is unaware that a
virtualenv is active, and will continue to use the system Python.  So
different command invocations are needed to run the same commands in a
virtualenv::

    # Run the Python interactive interpreter
    python

    # Execute an installed module (these could use python -m,
    # which is longer to type but is a little mopre similar to the
    # launcher approach)
    pip install pytest
    py.test

Having to use different commands is is error-prone, and in many cases
the error is difficult to spot immediately. The PEP proposes making
the ``py`` command usable with virtual environments, so that the first
form of command can be used in all cases.


Implementation
==============

Both ``virtualenv`` and the core ``venv`` module set an environment
variable ``VIRTUAL_ENV`` when activating a virtualenv.  This PEP
proposes that the launcher checks for the ``VIRTUAL_ENV`` environment
variable whenever it would run the "default" Python interpreter for
the system (i.e., when no specific version flags such as ``py -2.7``
are used) and if present, run the Python interpreter for the
virtualenv rather than the default system Python.

The "default" Python interpreter referred to above is (as per PEP 397)
either the latest version of Python installed on the system, or
a version configured via the ``py.ini`` configuration file.  When the
user specifies an explicit Python version on the command line, this
will always be used (as at present).


Impact on Script Launching
==========================


As well as interactive use, the launcher is used as the Windows file
association for Python scripts.  In that case, a "shebang" (``#!``)
line at the start of the script is used to identify the interpreter to
run.  A fully-qualified path can be used, or a version-specific Python
(``python3`` or ``python2``, or even ``python3.5``), or the generic
``python``, which means to use the default interpreter.

The launcher also looks for the specific shebang line
``#!/usr/bin/env python``. On Unix, the ``env`` program searches for a
command on ``$PATH`` and runs the command so located. Similarly, with
this shebang line, the launcher will look for a copy of ``python.exe``
on the user's current ``%PATH%`` and will run that copy.

As activating a virtualenv means that it is added to ``PATH``, no
special handling is needed to run scripts with the active virtualenv -
they just need to use the ``#!/usr/bin/env python`` shebang line,
exactly as on Unix. (If there is no activated virtualenv, and no
``python.exe`` on ``PATH``, the launcher will look for a default
Python exactly as if the shebang line had said ``#!python``).


Exclusions
==========

The PEP makes no attempt to promote the use of the launcher for
running Python on Windows.  Most existing documentation assumes the
user of ``python`` as the command to run Python, and (for example)
``pip`` to run an installed Python command.  This documentation is not
expected to change, and users who choose to manage their ``PATH``
environment variable can continue to use this form.  The focus of this
PEP is purely on allowing users who prefer to use the launcher when
dealing with their system Python installations, to be able to continue
to do so when using virtual environments.
