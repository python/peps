Abstract
========

This PEP adds a boolean member to the instances of ``datetime.time``
and ``datetime.datetime`` classes that can be used to differentiate
between two moments in time for which local times are the same.

Rationale
=========

In the most world locations there have been and will be times when
local clocks are moved back.  In those times intervals are introduced
in which local clocks show the same time twice in the same day.  In
these situations, the information displayed on a local clock (or
stored in a Python datetime instance) is insufficient to identify a
particular moment in time.  The proposed solution is to add a boolean
flag to the ``datetime`` instances that will distinguish between the
two ambiguous times.

Proposal
========

The "first" flag
----------------

We propose adding a boolean member called ``first`` to the instances
of ``datetime.time`` and ``datetime.datetime`` classes.  This member
should have the value True for all instances except those that
represent the second (chronologically) moment in time in an ambiguous
case.

Affected APIs
-------------

Attributes
..........

Instances of ``datetime.time`` and ``datetime.datetime`` will get a
new boolean attribute called "first."

Constructors
............

The ``__new__`` methods of the ``datetime.time`` and
``datetime.datetime`` classes will get a new keyword-only argument
called ``first`` with the default value ``True``.  The value of the
``first`` argument will be used to initialize the value of the
``first`` attribute in the returned instance.

Methods
.......

The ``replace()`` methods of the ``datetime.time`` and
``datetime.datetime`` classes will get a new keyword-only argument
called ``first`` with the default value ``True``.  It will
becave similarly to the other ``replace()`` arguments: if the ``first``
argument is specified and given a boolean value, the new instance
returned by ``replace()`` will have its ``first`` attribute set
to that value.  In CPython, a non-boolean value of ``first`` will
raise a ``TypeError``, but other implementations may allow the value
``None`` to behave the same as when ``first`` is not given.  If the
``first`` argument is not specified, the original value of the ``first``
attribute is copied to the result.   

Affected Behaviors
------------------

Conversion from naive to aware
..............................

The ``astimezone()`` method will now work for naive ``self``.  The
system local timezone will be assumed in this case and the ``first``
flag will be used to determine which local timezone is in effect
in the ambiguous case.

For example, on a system set to US/Eastern timezone::

  >>> dt = datetime(2014, 11, 2, 1, 30)
  >>> dt.astimezone().strftime('%D %T %Z%z')
  '11/02/14 01:30:00 EDT-0400'
  >>> dt.replace(first=False).astimezone().strftime('%D %T %Z%z')
  '11/02/14 01:30:00 EST-0500'

Conversion to POSIX seconds from EPOCH
......................................

The ``timestamp()`` method of ``datetime.datetime`` will return different
values for ``datetime.datetime`` instances that differ only by the value
of their ``first`` attribute if and only if these instances represent an
ambiguous or a non-existent value.

When a ``datetime.datetime`` instance ``dt`` represents an ambiguous
(repeated) time, there are two values ``s0`` and ``s1`` such that::

  datetime.fromtimestamp(s0) == datetime.fromtimestamp(s1) == dt

In this case, ``dt.timestamp()`` will return the smaller of ``s0``
and ``s1`` values if ``dt.first == True`` and the larger otherwise.


For example, on a system set to US/Eastern timezone::

  >>> datetime(2014, 11, 2, 1, 30, first=True).timestamp()
  1414906200.0
  >>> datetime(2014, 11, 2, 1, 30, first=False).timestamp()
  1414909800.0


When a ``datetime.datetime`` instance ``dt`` represents an invalid
time, there is no value ``s`` for which::

  datetime.fromtimestamp(s) == dt

but we can form two "nice to know" values of ``s`` that differ
by the size of the gap in seconds.  One is the value of ``s``
that would correspond to ``dt`` in a timezone where the UTC offset
is always the same as the offset right before the gap and the
other is the similar value but in a timezone the  UTC offset
is always the same as the offset right after the gap.

The value returned by ``dt.timestamp()`` given the invalid
``dt`` will be the larger of the two "nice to know" values
if ``dt.first  == True`` and the larger otherwise.

For example, on a system set to US/Eastern timezone::

  >>> datetime(2015, 3, 8, 2, 30, first=True).timestamp()
  1425799800.0
  >>> datetime(2015, 3, 8, 2, 30, first=False).timestamp()
  1425796200.0


Conversion from POSIX seconds from EPOCH
........................................


The ``fromtimestamp()`` static method of ``datetime.datetime`` will
set the ``first`` attribute appropriately in the returned object.

For example, on a system set to US/Eastern timezone::

  >>> datetime.fromtimestamp(1414906200)
  datetime.datetime(2014, 11, 2, 1, 30)
  >>> datetime.fromtimestamp(1414906200 + 3600)
  datetime.datetime(2014, 11, 2, 1, 30, first=False)


Implementations of tzinfo in stdlib
...................................

No new implementations of ``datetime.tzinfo`` abstract class are
introduced in this PEP.  The existing (fixed offset) timezones do
not introduce ambiguous local times and their ``utcoffset()``
implementation will return the same constant value as they do now
regardless of the value of ``first``. 

New guidelines will be published for implementing concrete timezones
with variable UTC offset.


Guidelines for new tzinfo implementations
-----------------------------------------

Implementors of concrete ``datetime.tzinfo`` subclasses who want to
support variable UTC offsets (due to DST and other causes) must follow
these guidelines.

New subclasses should override the baseclass ``fromutc()`` method so
that in all cases where two UTC times ``u1`` and ``u2`` (``u1`` <``u2``)
corespond to the same local time ``fromutc(u1)`` will return an instance
with ``first=True`` and ``fromutc(u1)`` will return an instance
with ``first=False``.

New implementations of ``utcoffset()`` and ``dst()`` methods should
ignore the value of ``first`` unless they are called on the ambiguous
or invalid times.

On an ambiguous time introduced at the end of DST, the values returned
by ``utcoffset()`` and ``dst()`` methods should be as follows

+-----------------+----------------+------------------+
|                 |   first=True   |    first=False   |
+-----------------+----------------+------------------+
|   utcoff()      | stdoff + hour  |    stdoff        |
+-----------------+----------------+------------------+
|    dst()        |     hour       |     zero         |
+-----------------+----------------+------------------+

where ``stdoff`` is the standard (non-DST) offset,
``hour = timedelta(hours=1)`` and ``zero = timedelta(0)``.

On an invalid time introduced at the start of DST, the values returned
by ``utcoffset()`` and ``dst()`` methods should	be as follows


+-----------------+----------------+------------------+
|                 |   first=True   |    first=False   |
+-----------------+----------------+------------------+
|   utcoff()      |     stdoff     |    stdoff + hour |
+-----------------+----------------+------------------+
|    dst()        |     zero       |     hour         |
+-----------------+----------------+------------------+


On ambiguous/invalid times introduced by the change in the standard time
offset, the ``dst()`` method should return the same value regardless of
the value of ``first`` and the ``utcoff()`` should return values
according to the following table:

+-----------------+----------------+-----------------------------+
|                 |   first=True   |    first=False              |
+-----------------+----------------+-----------------------------+
|   ambiguous     |     oldoff     |     newoff = oldoff - delta |
+-----------------+----------------+-----------------------------+
|   invalid       |     oldoff     |     newoff = oldoff + delta |
+-----------------+----------------+-----------------------------+



Pickle size
-----------

Pickle sizes for the ``datetime.datetime`` and ``datetime.time``
objects will not change.  The ``first`` flag will be encoded in the
first bit of the 5th byte of the ``datetime.datetime`` pickle payload
or the 2nd byte of the datetime.time. In the `current implementation`_
these bytes are used to store minute value (0-59) and the first bit is
always 0.  Note that ``first=True`` will be encoded as 0 in the first
bit and ``first=False`` as 1.  (This change only affects pickle
format.  In C implementation, the "first" member will get a full byte
to store the actual boolean value.)

We chose the minute byte to store the the "first" bit because this
choice preserves the natural ordering.

.. _current implementation: https://hg.python.org/cpython/file/d3b20bff9c5d/Include/datetime.h#l17

Temporal Arithmetics
--------------------

The value of "first" will be ignored in all operations except those
that involve conversion between timezones. [#]_

The result of addition (subtraction) of a timedelta to (from) a
datetime will always have ``first`` set to ``True`` even if the
original datetime instance had ``first=False``.

(The only methods that will be able to produce non-default value of
"first" are ``__new__``, and ``replace()`` methods of the
``datetime.datetime`` and ``datetime.time`` classes ``now()``,
``astimezone()`` and ``fromtimestamp()`` methods of the
``datetime.datetime`` class, and ``fromutc()`` method of some tzinfo
implementations.)


.. [#] As of Python 3.5, ``tzinfo`` is ignored whenever timedelta is
   added or subtracted from a ``datetime.datetime`` instance or when
   one ``datetime.datetime`` instance is subtracted from another with
   the same (even not-None) ``tzinfo``.  This may change in the future,
   but such changes are outside of the scope of this PEP.

Comparison
----------

Instances of ``datetime.time`` and ``datetime.datetime`` classes that
differ only by the value of their ``first`` attribute will compare as
equal.


Backward and Forward Compatibility
----------------------------------

This proposal will have no effect on the programs that do not set the
``first`` flag explicitly or use tzinfo implementations that do.
Pickles produced by older programs will remain fully forward
compatible.  Only datetime/time instances with ``first=False`` pickled
in the new versions will become unreadable by the older Python
versions.  Pickles of instances with ``first=True`` (which is the
default) will remain unchanged.

Questions and Answers
=====================

1. Why not call the new flag "isdst"?

-------

* Alice:  Bob - let's have a stargazing party at 01:30 AM tomorrow!
* Bob:  Should I presume initially that summer time (for example, Daylight
  Saving Time) is or is not (respectively) in effect for the specified time?
* Alice: Huh?

-------

* Bob: Alice - let's have a stargazing party at 01:30 AM tomorrow!
* Alice: You know, Bob, 01:30 AM will happen twice tomorrow. Which time do you have in mind?
* Bob:  I did not think about it, but let's pick the first.


2. Why "first"?

* Rejections:

  **second**   
      rejected because "second" is already there.
   
  **later**
      rejected because "later" is confusable with "latter".
   
  **earlier**
      rejected because "earlier" has the same issue as "first" (requires
      default to be True) but is two characters longer.
   
* Remaining possibilities:
 
  **repeated**
      this is a strong candidate
 
  **is_first**
      arguably more grammatically correct than "first"
 
  **ltdf**
      (Local Time Disambiguation Flag) - short and no-one will
      attempt to guess what it means without reading the docs.
