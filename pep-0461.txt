Abstract
========

This PEP proposes adding % formatting operations similar to Python 2's ``str``
type to ``bytes`` and ``bytearray`` [1]_ [2]_.


Rationale
=========

While interpolation is usually thought of as a string operation, there are
cases where interpolation on ``bytes`` or ``bytearrays`` make sense, and the
work needed to make up for this missing functionality detracts from the overall
readability of the code.


Motivation
==========

With Python 3 and the split between ``str`` and ``bytes``, one small but
important area of programming became slightly more difficult, and much more
painful -- wire format protocols [3]_.

This area of programming is characterized by a mixture of binary data and
ASCII compatible segments of text (aka ASCII-encoded text).  Bringing back a
restricted %-interpolation for ``bytes`` and ``bytearray`` will aid both in
writing new wire format code, and in porting Python 2 wire format code.


Overriding Principles
=====================

In order to avoid the problems of auto-conversion and Unicode exceptions
that could plague Python 2 code, ``str`` objects will not be supported as
interpolation values [4]_ [5]_.


Proposed semantics for ``bytes`` and ``bytearray`` formatting
=============================================================

%-interpolation
---------------

All the numeric formatting codes (such as ``%x``, ``%o``, ``%e``, ``%f``,
``%g``, etc.) will be supported, and will work as they do for str, including
the padding, justification and other related modifiers.

Example::

   >>> b'%4x' % 10
   b'   a'

   >>> '%#4x' % 10
   ' 0xa'

   >>> '%04X' % 10
   '000A'

``%c`` will insert a single byte, either from an ``int`` in range(256), or from
a ``bytes`` argument of length 1, not from a ``str``.

Example::

    >>> b'%c' % 48
    b'0'

    >>> b'%c' % b'a'
    b'a'

``%s`` is restricted in what it will accept::

  - input type supports ``Py_buffer`` [6]_?
    use it to collect the necessary bytes

  - input type is something else?
    use its ``__bytes__`` method [7]_ ; if there isn't one, raise a ``TypeError``

Examples::

    >>> b'%s' % b'abc'
    b'abc'

    >>> b'%s' % 3.14
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TypeError: 3.14 has no __bytes__ method, use a numeric code instead

    >>> b'%s' % 'hello world!'
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TypeError: 'hello world' has no __bytes__ method, perhaps you need to encode it?

.. note::

   Because the ``str`` type does not have a ``__bytes__`` method, attempts to
   directly use ``'a string'`` as a bytes interpolation value will raise an
   exception.  To use strings they must be encoded or otherwise transformed
   into a ``bytes`` sequence::

      'a string'.encode('latin-1')

``%a`` will call ``ascii()`` on the interpolated value's ``repr()``.
This is intended as a debugging aid, rather than something that should be used
in production.  Non-ascii values will be encoded to either ``\xnn`` or ``\unnnn``
representation.


Unsupported codes
-----------------

``%r`` (which calls ``__repr__`` and returns a '`str`') is not supported.


Proposed variations
===================

It was suggested to let ``%s`` accept numbers, but since numbers have their own
format codes this idea was discarded.

It has been proposed to automatically use ``.encode('ascii','strict')`` for
``str`` arguments to ``%s``.

  - Rejected as this would lead to intermittent failures.  Better to have the
    operation always fail so the trouble-spot can be correctly fixed.

It has been proposed to have ``%s`` return the ascii-encoded repr when the
value is a ``str`` (b'%s' % 'abc'  --> b"'abc'").

  - Rejected as this would lead to hard to debug failures far from the problem
    site.  Better to have the operation always fail so the trouble-spot can be
    easily fixed.

Originally this PEP also proposed adding format-style formatting, but it was
decided that format and its related machinery were all strictly text (aka
``str``) based, and it was dropped.

Various new special methods were proposed, such as ``__ascii__``,
``__format_bytes__``, etc.; such methods are not needed at this time, but can
be visited again later if real-world use shows deficiencies with this solution.


Objections
==========

The objections raised against this PEP were mainly variations on two themes::

  - the ``bytes`` and ``bytearray`` types are for pure binary data, with no
    assumptions about encodings
  - offering %-interpolation that assumes an ASCII encoding will be an
    attractive nuisance and lead us back to the problems of the Python 2
    ``str``/``unicode`` text model

As was seen during the discussion, ``bytes`` and ``bytearray`` are also used
for mixed binary data and ASCII-compatible segments: file formats such as
``dbf`` and ``pdf``, network protocols such as ``ftp`` and ``email``, etc.

``bytes`` and ``bytearray`` already have several methods which assume an ASCII
compatible encoding.  ``upper()``, ``isalpha()``, and ``expandtabs()`` to name
just a few.  %-interpolation, with its very restricted mini-language, will not
be any more of a nuisance than the already existing methdods.


Open Questions
==============

It has been suggested to use ``%b`` for bytes as well as ``%s``.

  - Pro: clearly says 'this is bytes'; should be used for new code.

  - Con: does not exist in Python 2.x, so we would have two ways of doing the
    same thing, ``%s`` and ``%b``, with no difference between them.
