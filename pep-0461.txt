Abstract
========

This PEP proposes adding % formatting operations similar to Python 2's ``str``
type to ``bytes`` [1]_ [2]_.


Overriding Principles
=====================

In order to avoid the problems of auto-conversion and Unicode exceptions that
could plague Py2 code, all object checking will be done by duck-typing, not by
values contained in a Unicode representation [3]_.


Proposed semantics for bytes formatting
=======================================

%-interpolation
---------------

All the numeric formatting codes (such as ``%x``, ``%o``, ``%e``, ``%f``,
``%g``, etc.) will be supported, and will work as they do for str, including
the padding, justification and other related modifiers.

Example::

   >>> b'%4x' % 10
   b'   a'

   >>> '%#4x' % 10
   ' 0xa'

   >>> '%04X' % 10
   '000A'

``%c`` will insert a single byte, either from an ``int`` in range(256), or from
a ``bytes`` argument of length 1, not from a ``str``.

Example:

    >>> b'%c' % 48
    b'0'

    >>> b'%c' % b'a'
    b'a'

``%s`` is restricted in what it will accept::

  - input type supports ``Py_buffer`` [4]_?
    use it to collect the necessary bytes

  - input type is something else?
    use its ``__bytes__`` method [5]_ ; if there isn't one, raise a ``TypeError``

Examples:

    >>> b'%s' % b'abc'
    b'abc'

    >>> b'%s' % 3.14
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TypeError: 3.14 has no __bytes__ method

    >>> b'%s' % 'hello world!'
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TypeError: 'hello world' has no __bytes__ method, perhaps you need to encode it?

.. note::

   Because the ``str`` type does not have a ``__bytes__`` method, attempts to
   directly use ``'a string'`` as a bytes interpolation value will raise an
   exception.  To use ``'string'`` values, they must be encoded or otherwise
   transformed into a ``bytes`` sequence::

      'a string'.encode('latin-1')


Numeric Format Codes
--------------------

To properly handle ``int`` and ``float`` subclasses, ``int()``, ``index()``,
and ``float()`` will be called on the objects intended for (``d``, ``i``,
``u``), (``b``, ``o``, ``x``, ``X``), and (``e``, ``E``, ``f``, ``F``, ``g``,
``G``).


Unsupported codes
-----------------

``%r`` (which calls ``__repr__``), and ``%a`` (which calls ``ascii()`` on
``__repr__``) are not supported.


Proposed variations
===================

It was suggested to let ``%s`` accept numbers, but since numbers have their own
format codes this idea was discarded.

It has been suggested to use ``%b`` for bytes instead of ``%s``.

  - Rejected as ``%b`` does not exist in Python 2.x %-interpolation, which is
    why we are using ``%s``.

It has been proposed to automatically use ``.encode('ascii','strict')`` for
``str`` arguments to ``%s``.

  - Rejected as this would lead to intermittent failures.  Better to have the
    operation always fail so the trouble-spot can be correctly fixed.

It has been proposed to have ``%s`` return the ascii-encoded repr when the
value is a ``str`` (b'%s' % 'abc'  --> b"'abc'").

  - Rejected as this would lead to hard to debug failures far from the problem
    site.  Better to have the operation always fail so the trouble-spot can be
    easily fixed.

Originally this PEP also proposed adding format style formatting, but it
was decided that format and its related machinery were all strictly text
(aka ``str``) based, and it was dropped.

Various new special methods were proposed, such as ``__ascii__``,
``__format_bytes__``, etc.; such methods are not needed at this time, but can
be visited again later if real-world use shows deficiencies with this solution.
