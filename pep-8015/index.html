<p>This PEP formalizes the current organization of the Python community and
proposes 3 main changes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Formalize the existing concept of “Python teams”;</li>
<li>Give more autonomy to Python teams;</li>
<li>Replace the BDFL (Guido van Rossum) with a new “Python Steering
Committee” of 5 members which has limited roles: basically decide how
decisions are taken, but don’t take decisions.</li>
</ul>
<p>PEPs are approved by a PEP delegate or by a vote (reserved to core
developers, need <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&gt;=</span> <span class="pre">2/3</span></code> majority).</p>

<section id="pep-rejection">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#pep-rejection" role="doc-backlink">PEP Rejection</a></h2>
<p><a class="pep reference internal" href="../pep-8015/" title="PEP 8015 – Organization of the Python community">PEP 8015</a> was rejected <a class="reference external" href="https://discuss.python.org/t/python-governance-vote-december-2018-results/546/">by a core developer vote</a>
described in <a class="pep reference internal" href="../pep-8001/" title="PEP 8001 – Python Governance Voting Process">PEP 8001</a> on Monday, December 17, 2018.</p>
<p><a class="pep reference internal" href="../pep-8016/" title="PEP 8016 – The Steering Council Model">PEP 8016</a> and the governance model it describes were chosen instead.</p>
</section>
<section id="rationale">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#rationale" role="doc-backlink">Rationale</a></h2>
<p>This PEP describes the organization of the whole Python development
community, from Python users to the Python Steering Committee.
Describing all groups and all roles in the same document helps to make
the organization more consistent.</p>
<p>The number of governance changes is minimized to get a smooth transition
from the old BDFL organization to the new Steering Committee
organization.</p>
<p>One key design of the organization is to avoid decision bottlenecks.
Discussions and decisions are distributed into Python teams where
experts in each topic can be found. The expectation is smoother
discussions on PEPs: fewer people with better knowledge of the topic.</p>
<p>Previously, most decisions have been taken by the Benevolent
Dictator For Life (BDFL), Guido van Rossum. The growing popularity of
Python increased the pressure on a single person. The proposed
organization distributes decisions and responsibilities to reduce the
pressure and avoid wearing any individual down.</p>
<p>To keep most of the decision power within the hands of the community,
the Python Steering Committee has very limited roles. The idea is to reduce the risk
that a group of people or companies “takes over” the Python project
through just a couple individuals. The project must remain autonomous
and open to everybody.</p>
<p>The most sensitives PEPs are decided by democracy: a vote reserved to
core developers, see the <a class="reference internal" href="#pep-process">PEP process</a> section below for the voting
method.</p>
</section>
<section id="common-guidelines">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#common-guidelines" role="doc-backlink">Common Guidelines</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The Python community is open to everyone.</li>
<li>Members must respect the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/">Python Community Code of Conduct</a> which ensures that
discussions remain constructive and that everybody feels welcomed.</li>
<li>Python is and will remain an autonomous project.</li>
<li>People with decisions power should reflect the diversity of its users
and contributors.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="community-organization">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#community-organization" role="doc-backlink">Community Organization</a></h2>
<p>Right now, there are different group of people involved in the Python
project. The more involved you are, the more decisions power you get. It
is important that the people acceding to the deepest group are the most
trusted ones.</p>
<p>This PEP formalizes the following groups:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Python Users</li>
<li>Python Contributors</li>
<li>Python Teams Members</li>
<li>Python Core Developers</li>
<li>Python Steering Committee Members</li>
<li>PSF Code of Conduct Workgroup</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="python-users">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#python-users" role="doc-backlink">Python Users</a></h2>
<p>This is the largest group: anyone who uses Python.</p>
</section>
<section id="python-contributors">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#python-contributors" role="doc-backlink">Python Contributors</a></h2>
<p>Once a Python user sends an email to a Python mailing list, comments on
the Python bug tracker, proposes or reviews a Python change, they become
a Python contributor.</p>
</section>
<section id="python-teams">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#python-teams" role="doc-backlink">Python Teams</a></h2>
<p>Python became too big to work as a unique team anymore, people
naturally have grouped themselves as teams to work more closely on
specific topics, sometimes called “Special Interest Group” (SIG).</p>
<p>When enough developers are interested by a specific topic, they can
create a new team. Usually, the main action is to ask the Python
postmaster to create a new “SIG” mailing list, but the team can choose
to use a different communication channel.</p>
<p>Team members are Python contributors and Python core developers. The
team is self-organized and is responsible to select who can join the
team and how.</p>
<p>Team members can get the bug triage permission on the team bug tracker
component. The more involved in a team you are, the more decisions power
and responsibilities you get.</p>
<p>A team might become allowed to decide on their own PEPs, but only the
Python Steering Committee can allow that (and it has the power to revoke
it as well). Such a case is exceptional, currently a single team has
such permission: the Packaging Team.</p>
<p>See <a class="reference internal" href="#annex-examples-of-python-teams">Annex: Examples of Python Teams</a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="python-core-developers">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#python-core-developers" role="doc-backlink">Python Core Developers</a></h2>
<p>One restricted definition of a core developer is the ability to merge a
change (anywhere in the code) and have the bug triage permission
(on all bug tracker components).</p>
<p>Core developers are developers who are proven to have the required skills to
decide if a change can be approved or must be rejected, but also (and
this is more important) what changes should not be made. Python has a
long history, big constraints on backward compatibility, high quality
standards (ex: changes require new tests). For these reasons, becoming
a core can take several months or longer.</p>
<p>Becoming a core developer means more responsibilities. For example, if a
developer merges a change, they become responsible for regressions and
for the maintenance of that modified code.</p>
<p>Core developers are expected to be exemplary when it comes to the Code
of Conduct. They are encouraged to mentor contributors.</p>
<section id="promote-a-contributor-as-core-developer">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#promote-a-contributor-as-core-developer" role="doc-backlink">Promote a contributor as core developer</a></h3>
<p>Once an existing core developer considers that a contributor is ready to
join the core group, to become a core developer, that core developer
asks the contributor if they would like to become a core developer. If
the contributor is interested in such new responsibilities, a vote is
organized.</p>
<p>The vote is reserved to core developers, is public, and is open for 1
week.  Usually the core developer who proposes the promotion has to
describe the work and skills of the candidate in the description of the
vote. A contributor is only promoted if two thirds (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&gt;=</span> <span class="pre">2/3</span></code>) of
votes approve (“+1”) the promotion. Only “+1” and “-1” votes are
accounted; other votes (ex: null, “-0”, “+0.5”) are ignored.</p>
<p>If the candidate is promoted, usually they get a mentor for 1 month to
help them to handle new responsibilities.</p>
<p>If the candidate is not promoted, a new vote can be organized later,
when the candidate gets the missing skills, for example 6 months later.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="python-steering-committee">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#python-steering-committee" role="doc-backlink">Python Steering Committee</a></h2>
<p>The Python Steering Committee is made of the most trusted core
developers since it has the most decision power. The roles of this group
are strictly limited to ensure that Python keeps its autonomy and
remains open.</p>
<p>The Python Steering Committee is composed of 5 members. They are elected
for 3 years and 1/3 is replaced every year (first year: 1, second year:
2, third year: 2). This way, a member will stay for one full Python
release and the committee composition will be updated frequently. A
committee member can be a candidate for the seat they are leaving.
There are no term limits.</p>
<p>Committee members must be Python core developers. It is important that
the members of the committee reflect the diversity of Python’ users and
contributors. A small step to ensure that is to enforce that only 2
members (strictly less than 50% of the 5 members) can work for the same
employer (same company or subsidiaries of the same company).</p>
<p>The size of 5 members has been chosen for the members diversity and to
ensure that the committee can continue to work even if a member becomes
unavailable for an unknown duration.</p>
<section id="python-steering-committee-roles">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#python-steering-committee-roles" role="doc-backlink">Python Steering Committee Roles</a></h3>
<p>Python Steering Committee roles:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Decide how a PEP is approved (or rejected or deferred).</li>
<li>Grant or revoke permissions to a Python team. For example, allow
a team to give the bug triage permission (on the team component) to a
contributor.</li>
</ul>
<p>To decide how a PEP is approved (or rejected or deferred), there are two
options:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The committee elects a PEP delegate (previously known as “BDFL-delegate”):
a core developer who will take the final decision for the specific
PEP. The committee select the PEP delegate who can be proposed by the
Python team where the PEP is discussed.</li>
<li>The committee can organize a vote on the PEP, see <a class="reference internal" href="#pep-process">PEP process</a>
for the vote organization. The committee decides when the vote is
organized. A vote is preferred for changes affecting all Python users,
like language changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>The committee keeps the “vision” and consistency of Python. It also makes
sure that important features reach completion. Their ability to pick PEP
delegates is meant to help them to achieve that goal.</p>
</section>
<section id="election-of-python-steering-committee-members">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#election-of-python-steering-committee-members" role="doc-backlink">Election of Python Steering Committee Members</a></h3>
<p>The vote is organized by the Steering Committee. It is announced 3 weeks
in advance: candidates have to apply during this period. The vote is
reserved to core developers and is open for 1 week. To avoid
self-censorship, the vote uses secret ballots: avoid the risk of
hostility from someone who may get more power (if they get elected).</p>
<p>The vote uses the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schulze_method">Schulze/Beatpath/CSSD variant</a> of the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method">Condorcet
method</a> using an
online service like <a class="reference external" href="https://civs.cs.cornell.edu/">Condorcet Internet Voting Service (CIVS)</a>. This voting method reduces the risk of
tie. It also produces a ranking of all candidates, needed for the
creation of the committee.</p>
<p>In case of tie, a new vote is organized immediately between candidates
involved in the tie using the same voting method and also during 1 week.
If the second vote leads to a tie again, the current Steering Committee
is responsible to select the elected member(s).</p>
<p>If a committee member steps down, a new vote is organized to replace
them.</p>
<p>If the situation of a committee member changes in a way that no longer
satisfies the committee constraint (ex: they move to the same company as
two other committee members), they have to resign. If the employer of a
member is acquired by the employer of two other members, the member with
the mandate ending earlier has to resign once the acquisition completes.</p>
</section>
<section id="election-creating-the-python-steering-committee-members">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#election-creating-the-python-steering-committee-members" role="doc-backlink">Election Creating the Python Steering Committee Members</a></h3>
<p>To bootstrap the process, 5 members are elected at the committee
creation. The vote follows the same rules than regular committee votes,
except that the election needs 5 members, and the vote is organized by
the PSF Board.</p>
<p>In a council election, if 3 of the top 5 vote-getters work for the
same employer, then whichever of them ranked lowest is disqualified
and the 6th-ranking candidate moves up into 5th place; this is
repeated until a valid council is formed.</p>
<p>In case of tie, a second vote is organized immediately between
candidates involved in the tie and following candidates to fill the
remaining seats. The vote follows the same rules as the regular
committee vote. If the second vote still result in a tie, the PSF Board
is responsible to elect members and decide their position in the vote
result.</p>
<p>The order in the vote result must be unique for elected members: #1 and
#2 are elected for 3 years, #2 and #3 for 2 years, and #5 for 1 year.</p>
<p>Example of vote result with a tie:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A</li>
<li>B</li>
<li>C</li>
<li>D</li>
<li>E, F</li>
<li>G</li>
<li>…</li>
</ul>
<p>The first 4 candidates (A, B, C and D) are elected immediately. If E
works for the same employer than two other elected member, F is also
elected. Otherwise, a second vote is organized for the 5th seat between
E and F.</p>

<p>A committee member can be a PEP delegate.</p>
<p>A committee member can propose a PEP, but cannot be the PEP delegate of
their own PEP.</p>
<p>When the committee decides that a PEP must be voted, committee members

any #python chat community &amp; python.org email list under PSF
jurisdiction.</li>
<li>Create a standard set of codes of conduct and supporting documents for
multiple channels of interaction such as, but not limited to,
conferences, mailing lists, slack/IRC, code repositories, and more.</li>
<li>Develop training materials and other processes to support Python

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#special-case-ban-a-core-developer" role="doc-backlink">Special Case: Ban a core developer</a></h3>
<p>As any other member of the Python community, the PSF Code of Conduct
Workgroup can ban a core developer for a limited amount of time. In this
case, the core developer immediately loses their core developer status.
Core developers are expected to be exemplary when it comes to the Code
of Conduct.</p>
<p>In general, a ban is only the last resort action when all other options
have been exhausted.</p>
<p>At the end of the ban, the developer is allowed to contribute again as a
regular contributor.</p>
<p>If the developer changes their behavior, another core developer can
organize a new vote to propose the developer for promotion to core
developer. The vote follows the same process than for any other Python
contributor.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#pep-process" role="doc-backlink">PEP process</a></h2>
<p>There are 2 main roles on PEPs:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>PEP Authors</li>
<li>PEP Delegate</li>
</ul>
<p>PEP Authors do their best to write high quality PEP.</p>
<p>The PEP delegate is responsible to help the authors to enhance their PEP
and is the one taking the final decision (accept, reject or defer the
PEP). They can also help to guide the discussion.</p>
<p>If no decision is taken, the authors can propose again the PEP later
(ex: one year later), if possible with new data to motivate the change. A
PEP Delegate can also choose to mark a PEP as “Deferred” to not reject
the PEP and encourage to reopen the discussion later.</p>
<p>PEPs specific to a Python team are discussed on the team mailing list.
PEPs impacting all Python developers (like language changes) must be
discussed on the python-dev mailing list.</p>
<section id="vote-on-a-pep">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#vote-on-a-pep" role="doc-backlink">Vote on a PEP</a></h3>
<p>When the Python Steering Committee decides that a PEP needs a wider
approval, a vote is organized.</p>
<p>The vote is reserved to core developers, is public, is announced 1 week
in advance, and is open for 1 week. The PEP can still be updated during
the 1 week notice, but must not be modified during the vote. Such vote
happens on
the mailing list where the PEP has been discussed. The committee decides
when the vote is organized. The PEP must have been discussed for a
reasonable amount of time before it is put to vote.</p>
<p>A PEP is only approved if two thirds (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&gt;=</span> <span class="pre">2/3</span></code>) of votes approve
(“+1”) the PEP.  Only “+1” and “-1” votes are accounted; other votes
(ex: null, “-0”, “+0.5”) are ignored.</p>
<p>A PEP can only be approved or rejected by a vote, not be deferred.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="lack-of-decision">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#lack-of-decision" role="doc-backlink">Lack of Decision</a></h2>
<p>If a discussion fails to reach a consensus, if the Python Steering
Committee fail to choose a PEP delegate, or if a PEP delegate fails to
take a decision, the obvious risk is that Python fails to evolve.</p>
<p>That’s fine. Sometimes, doing nothing is the wisest choice.</p>
</section>
<section id="change-this-pep">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#change-this-pep" role="doc-backlink">Change this PEP</a></h2>
<p>The first version of this PEP has been written after Guido van Rossum
decided to resign from his role of BDFL in July 2018. Before this PEP,
the roles of Python community members have never been formalized. It is
difficult to design a perfect organization at the first attempt. This
PEP can be updated in the future to adjust the organization, specify how
to handle corner cases and fix mistakes.</p>
<p>Any change to this PEP must be validated by a vote. The vote is
announced 3 weeks in advance, is reserved to core developers, happens in
public on the python-committers mailing list, and is open for 1 week.
The proposed PEP change can still be updated during the 3 weeks notice,
but must not be modified during the vote.</p>
<p>The change is only approved if four fifths (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&gt;=</span> <span class="pre">4/5</span></code>) of votes approve
(“+1”) the change. Only “+1” and “-1” votes are accounted; other votes
(ex: null, “-0”, “+0.5”) are ignored.</p>

<li>Specify the Condorcet method: use Schulze/Beatpath/CSSD variant to
elect Python Steering Committee members. Specify how to deal with
tie and the constraint on the employers.</li>
<li>Vote on promoting a contributor and on PEPs now requires <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&gt;=</span> <span class="pre">2/3</span></code>

<li>Adjust votes: open for 1 week instead of 1 month, and announced
in advance.</li>
<li>Rename the “Python Core Board” to the “Python Steering Committee”;</li>
<li>Clarify that this committee doesn’t approve PEPs and that committee
members cannot cumulate more than 2 mandates;</li>
