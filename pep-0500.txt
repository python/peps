Abstract
========

This PEP specifies a new protocol (PDDM - "A Protocol for Delegating
Datetime Methods") that can be used by concrete implementations of the
``datetime.tzinfo`` interface to override aware datetime arithmetics,
formatting and parsing.  We describe changes to the
``datetime.datetime`` class to support the new protocol and propose a
new abstract class ``datetime.tzstrict`` that implements parts of this
protocol necessary to make aware datetime instances to follow "strict"
arithmetic rules.


Rationale
=========

As of Python 3.5, aware datetime instances that share a ``tzinfo``
object follow the rules of arithmetics that are induced by a simple
bijection between (year, month, day, hour, minute, second,
microsecond) 7-tuples and large integers.  In this arithmetics, the
difference between YEAR-11-02T12:00 and YEAR-11-01T12:00 is always 24
hours, even though in the US/Eastern timezone, for example, there are
25 hours between 2014-11-01T12:00 and 2014-11-02T12:00 because the
local clocks were rolled back one hour at 2014-11-02T02:00,
introducing an extra hour in the night between 2014-11-01 and
2014-11-02.

Many business applications requre the use of Python's simplified view
of local dates.  No self-respecting car rental company will charge its
customers more for a week that straddles the end of DST than for any
other week or require that they return the car an hour early.
Therefore, changing the current rules for aware datetime arithmentics
will not only create a backward compatibility nightmare, it will
eliminate support for legitimate and common use cases.

Since it is impossible to choose universal rules for local time
arithmetics, we propose to delegate implementation of those rules to
the classes that implement ``datetime.tzinfo`` interface.  With such
delegation in place, users will be able to choose between different
arithmetics by simply picking instances of different classes for the
value of ``tzinfo``.


Protocol
========

Subtraction of datetime
-----------------------

A ``tzinfo`` subclass supporting the PDDM, may define a method called
``__datetime_diff__`` that should take two ``datetime.datetime``
instances and return a ``datetime.timedelta`` instance representing
the time elapced from the time represented by the first datetime
instance to another.


Addition
--------

A ``tzinfo`` subclass supporting the PDDM, may define a method called
``__datetime_add__`` that should take two arguments--a datetime and a
timedelta instances--and return a datetime instance.


Subtraction of timedelta
------------------------

A ``tzinfo`` subclass supporting the PDDM, may define a method called
``__datetime_sub__`` that should take two arguments--a datetime and a
timedelta instances--and return a datetime instance.
 

Formatting
----------

A ``tzinfo`` subclass supporting the PDDM, may define methods called
``__datetime_isoformat__`` and ``__datetime_strftime__``.

The ``__datetime_isoformat__`` method should take a datetime instance
and an optional separator and produce a string representation of the
given datetime instance.

The ``__datetime_strftime__`` method should take a datetime instance
and a format string and produce a string representation of the given
datetime instance formatted according to the given format.


Parsing
-------

A ``tzinfo`` subclass supporting the PDDM, may define a class method
called ``__datetime_strptime__`` and register the "canonical" names of
the timezones that it implements with a registry. **TODO** Describe a
registry.


Changes to datetime methods
===========================

Subtraction
-----------

::

   class datetime:
       def __sub__(self, other):
           if isinstance(other, datetime):
               try:
                   self_diff = self.tzinfo.__datetime_diff__
               except AttributeError:
                   self_diff = None
               try:
                   other_diff = self.tzinfo.__datetime_diff__
               except AttributeError:
                   other_diff = None
               if self_diff is not None:
                   if self_diff is not other_diff and self_diff.__func__ is not other_diff.__func__:
                       raise ValueError("Cannot find difference of two datetimes with "
                                        "different tzinfo.__datetime_diff__ implementations.")
		   return self_diff(self, other)
	   elif isinstance(other, timedelta):
               try:
                   sub = self.tzinfo.__datetime_sub__
               except AttributeError:
                   pass
               else:
                   return sub(self, other)
               return self + -other
           else:
               return NotImplemented
           # current implementation


Addition
--------

Addition of a timedelta to a datetime instance will be delegated to the
``self.tzinfo.__datetime_add__`` method whenever it is defined.


Strict arithmetics
==================

A new abstract subclass of ``datetime.tzinfo`` class called  ``datetime.tzstrict``
will be added to the ``datetime`` module.  This subclass will not implement the
``utcoffset()``, ``tzname()`` or ``dst()`` methods, but will implement some of the
methods of the PDDM.

The PDDM methods implemented by ``tzstrict`` will be equivalent to the following::

  class tzstrict(tzinfo):
      def __datetime_diff__(self, dt1, dt2):
          utc_dt1 = dt1.astimezone(timezone.utc)
          utc_dt2 = dt2.astimezone(timezone.utc)
	  return utc_dt2 - utc_dt1 

      def __datetime_add__(self, dt, delta):
          utc_dt = dt.astimezone(timezone.utc)
	  return (utc_dt + delta).astimezone(self)

      def __datetime_sub__(self, dt, delta):
          utc_dt = dt.astimezone(timezone.utc)
	  return (utc_dt - delta).astimezone(self)


Parsing and formatting
----------------------

Datetime methods ``strftime`` and ``isoformat`` will delegate to the namesake
methods of their ``tzinfo`` members whenever those methods are defined.

When the ``datetime.strptime`` method is given a format string that
contains a ``%Z`` instruction, it will lookup the ``tzinfo``
implementation in the registry by the given timezone name and call its
``__datetime_strptime__`` method.

Applications
============

This PEP will enable third party implementation of many different
timekeeping schemes including:

* Julian / Microsoft Excel calendar.
* "Right" timezones with the leap second support.
* French revolutionary calendar (with a lot of work).
