Abstract
========

This is a proposal to allow augmented assignment statements such as
``x += 1`` to be used as expressions when the assignment target is a
simple name.

For example, this will allow operation retry loops to be written as::

    remaining_attempts = 10
    while remaining_attempts -= 1:
        try:
            result = attempt_operation()
        except Exception as exc:
            continue # Failed, so try again
        break # Success!
    else:
        # Ran out of attempts before succeeding
        raise OperationFailed("No more attempts remaining") from exc

It is a direct competitor to PEP 572 (although it borrows heavily from that
PEP's motivation, and even borrows its proposed syntax for a slightly
different purpose).

As part of this, a semantic split is proposed between the handling of augmented
assignments in regular block scopes (modules, classes, and functions), and the
handling of augmented assignments in scoped expressions (lambda expressions,
generator expressions, and comprehensions), such that augmented assignments
default to targeting the nearest containing block scope.

A new compile time ``TargetNameError`` is added as a subclass of ``SyntaxError``
to handle cases where it either isn't clear to the compiler which target is
expected to be rebound by an augmented assignment, or else the augmented
assignment target scope is invalid for another reason.

Finally, ``NAME := EXPR`` is proposed as a name rebinding expression that
uses the new augmented assignment scoping rules, rather than implicitly
defining a new local variable name the way that existing name binding
statements do.


Relationship with PEP 572
=========================

The case for allowing inline assignments at all is made in PEP 572. This
competing PEP was initially going to propose an alternate surface syntax
(``EXPR given NAME = EXPR``), while retaining the expression semantics from
PEP 572, but that changed when discussing one of the initial motivating use
cases for allowing embedded assignments at all: making it possible to easily
calculate cumulative sums in comprehensions and generator expressions.

As a result of that, and unlike PEP 572, this PEP focuses primarily on use
cases for inline augmented assignment. It also has the effect of converting
cases that currently inevitably raise ``UnboundLocalError`` at function call
time to report a new compile time ``TargetNameError``.

New syntax for a name rebinding expression (``NAME := TARGET``) is then added
primarily as a lower level primitive to help illustrate, implement and explain
the new augmented assignment semantics, rather than being the sole change being
proposed.

The author of this PEP believes that this approach makes the value of the new
flexibility in name rebinding clearer, while also mitigating many of the
potential concerns raised with PEP 572 around explaining when to use
``NAME = EXPR`` over ``NAME := EXPR`` (and vice-versa).


Syntax and semantics
====================

Augmented assignment expressions
--------------------------------

The language grammar would be adjusted to allow augmented assignments that
target simple names to appear as expressions, where the result of the
augmented assignment expression is the same post-calculation reference as is
being bound to the given target.

For example::

    >>> n = 0
    >>> n += 5
    5
    >>> n -= 2
    3
    >>> n *= 3
    9
    >>> n
    9

Augmented assignments to attributes and container subscripts will continue to
be restricted to the standalone statement form, and will be defined as
returning ``None`` for purposes of interactive use. While a future PEP could
potentially make the case for allowing those more complex targets as expressions,
this PEP doesn't attempt to do so due to the ambiguity around whether or not
they should call ``__getitem__`` and/or ``__getattribute`` on the target
expression after performing the assignment, or else just return a reference to
the binary operation result being assigned.

(Note: as an implementation detail, the language grammar itself may allow all
existing permitted targets for all augmented assignments, regardless of whether
they're appearing as an expression or a statement, with the restriction to
statement level usage for more complex targets being implemented at the AST
generation step).


Augmented assignment in block scopes
------------------------------------

No target name binding changes are proposed for augmented assignments at module
or class scope (this also includes code executed using "exec" or "eval"). These
will continue to implicitly declare a new local variable as the binding target
as they do today, and (if necessary) will be able to resolve the name from an
outer scope before binding it locally.

At function scope, augmented assignments will be changed to require that there
be either a preceding name binding or variable declaration to explicitly
establish the target name as being local to the function, or else an explicit
``global`` or ``nonlocal`` declaration. A new ``SyntaxError`` subclass,
``TargetNameError`` will be raised at compile time if no such binding or
declaration is present.

For example, the following code would compile and run as it does today:

    x = 0
    x += 1 # Sets global "x" to 1

    class C:
        x += 1 # Sets local "x" to 2, leaves global "x" alone

    def local_target():
        x = 0
        x += 1 # Sets local "x" to 1, leaves global "x" alone

    def global_target():
        global x
        x += 1 # Increments global "x" each time this runs

    def nonlocal_target():
        x = 0
        def g():
            nonlocal x
            x += 1 # Increments "x" in outer scope each time this runs
            return x
        return g

The follow examples would all still compile and then raise an error at runtime
as they do today:

    n += 1 # Raises NameError at runtime

    class C:
        n += 1 # Raises NameError at runtime

    def missing_global():
        global n
        n += 1 # Raises NameError at runtime

    def delayed_nonlocal_initialisation():
        def f():
            nonlocal n
            n += 1
        f() # Raises NameError at runtime
        n = 0

    def skipped_conditional_initialisation():
        if False:
            n = 0
        n += 1 # Raises UnboundLocalError at runtime

    def local_declaration_without_initial_assignment():
        n : typing.Any
        n += 1 # Raises UnboundLocalError at runtime

Whereas the following would raise a compile time ``DeprecationWarning``
initially, and eventually change to report a compile time ``TargetNameError``::

    def missing_target():
        x += 1 # Compile time TargetNameError due to ambiguous target scope
               # Is there a missing initialisation of "x" here? Or a missing
               # global or nonlocal declaration?

As a conservative implementation approach, the compile time function name
resolution change would be introduced as a ``DeprecationWarning`` in Python
3.8, and then converted to ``TargetNameError`` in Python 3.9. This avoids
potential problems in cases where an unused function would currently raise
``UnboundLocalError`` if it was ever actually called, but the code is actually
unused - converting that latent runtime defect to a compile time error qualifies
as a backwards incompatible change that requires a deprecation period.


Augmented assignment in scoped expressions
------------------------------------------

Scoped expressions is a new collective term being proposed for expressions that
introduce a new nested scope of execution, either as an intrinsic part of their
operation (lambda expressions, generator expressions), or else as a way of
hiding name binding operations from the containing scope (container
comprehensions).

Unlike regular functions, these scoped expressions can't include explicit
``global`` or ``nonlocal`` declarations to rebind names directly in an outer
scope.

Instead, their name binding semantics for augmented assignment expressions would
be defined as follows:

* augmented assignment targets used in scoped expressions are expected to either
  be already bound in the containing block scope, or else have their scope
  explicitly declared in the containing block scope. If no suitable name
  binding or declaration can be found in that scope, then ``TargetNameError``
  will be raised at compile time (rather than creating a new binding within
  the scoped expression).
* if the containing block scope is a class scope, than ``TargetNameError`` will
  always be raised, with a dedicated message indicating that combining class
  scopes with augmented assignments in scoped expressions is not currently
  permitted.
* if a name is declared as a formal parameter (lambda expressions), or as an
  iteration variable (generator expressions, comprehensions), then that name
  is considered local to that scoped expression, and attempting to use it as
  the target of an augmented assignment operation in that scope, or any nested
  scoped expression, will raise ``TargetNameError`` (this is a restriction that
  could potentially be lifted later, but is being proposed for now to simplify
  the initial set of compile time and runtime semantics that needs to be
  covered in the language reference and handled by the compiler and interpreter)

For example, the following code would work as shown::

    >>> global_target = 0
    >>> incr_global_target = lambda: global_target += 1
    >>> incr_global_target()
    1
    >>> incr_global_target()
    2
    >>> global_target
    2
    >>> def cumulative_sums(data, start=0)
    ...    total = start
    ...    yield from (total += value for value in data)
    ...    return total
    ...
    >>> print(list(cumulative_sums(range(5))))
    [0, 1, 3, 6, 10]

While the following examples would all raise ``TargetNameError``::

    class C:
        cls_target = 0
        incr_cls_target = lambda: cls_target += 1 # Error due to class scope

    def missing_target():
        incr_x = lambda: x += 1 # Error due to missing target "x"

    def late_target():
        incr_x = lambda: x += 1 # Error due to "x" being declared before use
        x = 1

    lambda arg: arg += 1 # Error due to attempt to target formal parameter

    [x += 1 for x in data] # Error due to attempt to target iteration variable


As augmented assignments currently can't appear inside scoped expressions, the
above compile time name resolution exceptions would be included as part of the
initial implementation rather than needing to be phased in as a potentially
backwards incompatible change.


Promoting nonlocal references to global references
--------------------------------------------------

As part of the above changes, all ``nonlocal NAME`` declarations (including
the implicit ones added for augmented assignment targets in scoped expressions
at function scope) will be changed to take explicit ``global NAME`` declarations
into account, such that the affected name is considered ``global`` in the inner
scope as well. For example, the following code would work by binding ``x`` in
the global scope instead of raising ``SyntaxError`` as it does today:

    >>> def f():
    ...     global x
    ...     def g():
    ...         nonlocal x
    ...         x = 1
    ...     g()
    >>> f()
    >>> x
    1


Adding an inline assignment expression
--------------------------------------

Given just the above changes, it would be possible to abuse a symbol like
``|=`` as a general purpose assignment operator by defining a ``Target`` wrapper
type that worked as follows::

    >>> class Target:
    ...     def __init__(self, value):
    ...         self.value = value
    ...     def __or__(self, other):
    ...         return Target(other)
    ...
    >>> x = Target(10)
    >>> x.value
    10
    >>> x |= 42
    <__main__.Target object at 0x7f608caa8048>
    >>> x.value
    42

Rather than requiring such workarounds, this PEP instead proposes that
PEP 572's "NAME := EXPR" syntax be adopted as a new inline assignment
expression that uses the augmented assignment scoping rules described above.

This cleanly handles cases where only the new value is of interest, and the
previously bound value (if any) can just be discarded completely.

As with other augmented assignment operators, function level usage would always
require a preceding name binding or scope declaration to avoid getting
``TargetNameError`` (as a new operator, there's no need for a
``DeprecationWarning`` period).

This difference in target scoping behaviour means that the ``NAME := EXPR``
syntax would be expected to have two primary use cases::

- as a way of allowing assignments to be embedded as an expression in an ``if``
  or ``while`` statement, or as part of a scoped expression
- as a way of requesting a compile time check that the target name be previously
  declared or bound in the current function scope

At module or class scope, ``NAME = EXPR`` and ``NAME := EXPR`` would be
semantically equivalent for technical reasons, but code linters and static
type checkers would be encouraged to enforce the same "declaration or assignment
required before use" behaviour for ``NAME := EXPR`` as the compiler would
enforce at function scope.

Unlike existing augmented assignment statements, inline assignment expressions
would be restricted entirely to single name targets (even when used as a
standalone statement).


Design discussion
=================

Restriction to single name targets
----------------------------------

This PEP keeps PEP 572's restriction to single name targets when augmented
assignments are used as expressions, restricting attribute and subscript
targets to the statement form.

While the case could be made that it would be more consistent to allow
those in the expression form as well, the rationale for excluding them is
that it's inherently ambiguous as to whether or not the expression form would
return the expression being bound, or the result of evaluating the LHS as
an expression (rather than as an assignment target).

If this restriction was deemed unduly confusing, then the simplest resolution
would be to retain the current semantics of augmented assignment statements
and have the expression result be the reference bound to the target (i.e.
``__getitem__`` and ``__getattribute__`` would *not* be called after the
assignment had already taken place)


Ignoring scoped expressions when determining augmented assignment targets
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

When discussing possible binding semantics for PEP 572's assignment expressions,
Tim Peters made a plausible case [1_,2_,3_] for assignment expressions targeting
the containing block scope, essentially ignoring any intervening scoped
expressions.

This approach allows use cases like cumulative sums, or extracting the final
value from a generator expression to be written in a relatively straightforward
way::

    total = 0
    partial_sums = [total := total + value for value in data]

    factor = 1
    while any(n % (factor := p) == 0 for p in small_primes):
        n //= factor

Guido also expressed his approval for this general approach [4_].

The proposal in this PEP differs from Tim's original proposal in three main
areas:

- it applies the proposal to all augmented assignment operators, not just a
  single new name binding operator
- as far as is practical, it extends the augmented assignment requirement that
  the name already be defined to the new name binding operator (raising
  ``TargetNameError`` rather than implicitly declaring new local variables at
  function scope)
- it includes lambda expressions in the set of scopes that gets ignored for
  target name binding purposes, making this transparency to assignments common
  to all of the scoped expressions rather than being specific to comprehensions
  and generator expressions

With scoped expressions being ignored when calculating binding targets, it's
once again difficult to detect the scoping difference between the outermost
iterable expressions in generator expressions and comprehensions (you have to
mess about with either class scopes or attempting to rebind iteration Variables
to detect it), so there's also no need to tinker with that.


Treating inline assignment as an augmented assignment variant
-------------------------------------------------------------

One of the challenges with PEP 572 is the fact that ``NAME = EXPR`` and
``NAME := EXPR`` are entirely semantically equivalent at every scope. This
makes the two forms hard to teach, since there's no inherent nudge towards
choosing one over the other at the statement level, so you end up having to
resort to "``NAME = EXPR`` is preferred because it's been around longer".

That semantic equivalence is difficult to avoid at module and class scope while
still having ``if NAME := EXPR:`` and ``while NAME := EXPR:`` work sensibly, but
at function scope the compiler's comprehensive view of all local names makes
it possible to require that the name be assigned or declared before use,
providing a reasonable incentive to continue to default to using the
``NAME = EXPR`` form when possible, while also enabling the use of the
``NAME := EXPR`` as a kind of simple compile time assertion (i.e. explicitly
indicating that the targeted name has already been bound or declared and hence
should already be known to the compiler).


Disallowing augmented assignments in class level scoped expressions
-------------------------------------------------------------------

While modern classes do define an implicit closure that's visible to method
implementations (in order to make ``__class__`` available for use in zero-arg
``super()`` calls), there's no way for user level code to explicitly add
additional names to that scope.

Meanwhile, attributes defined in a class body are ignored for the purpose of
defining a method's lexical closure, which means adding them there wouldn't
work at an implementation level.

Rather than trying to resolve that inherent ambiguity, this PEP simply
prohibits such usage, and requires that any affected logic be written somewhere
other than directly inline in the class body (e.g. in a separate helper
function).


Examples
========

Simplifying retry loops
-----------------------

There are currently a few different options for writing retry loops, including::

    # Post-decrementing a counter
    remaining_attempts = 9
    while remaining_attempts:
        try:
            result = attempt_operation()
        except Exception as exc:
            remaining_attempts -= 1
            continue # Failed, so try again
        break # Success!
    else:
        # Ran out of attempts before succeeding
        raise OperationFailed("No more attempts remaining") from exc

    # Loop-and-a-half with a pre-decremented counter
    remaining_attempts = 10
    while True:
        remaining_attempts -= 1
        if not remaining_attempts:
            # Ran out of attempts before succeeding
            raise OperationFailed("No more attempts remaining") from exc
        try:
            result = attempt_operation()
        except Exception as exc:
            continue # Failed, so try again
        break # Success!

Each of the available options hides some aspect of the intended loop structure
inside the loop body, whether that's the state modification, the exit condition,
or both.

The proposal in this PEP allows both the state modification and the exit
condition to be included directly in the loop header::

    remaining_attempts = 10
    while remaining_attempts -= 1:
        try:
            result = attempt_operation()
        except Exception as exc:
            continue # Failed, so try again
        break # Success!
    else:
        # Ran out of attempts before succeeding
        raise OperationFailed("No more attempts remaining") from exc


Simplifying if-elif chains
--------------------------

if-elif chains that need to rebind the checked condition currently need to
be written using nested if-else statements::


    m = pattern.match(data)
    if m:
        ...
    else:
        m = other_pattern.match(data)
        if m:
            ...
        else:
            m = yet_another_pattern.match(data)
            if m:
                ...
            else:
                ...

As with PEP 572, this PEP allows the else/if portions of that chain to be
condensed, making their consistent and mutually exclusive structure more
readily apparent::

    m = pattern.match(data)
    if m:
        ...
    elif m := other_pattern.match(data):
        ...
    elif m := yet_another_pattern.match(data):
        ...
    else:
        ...

Unlike PEP 572, this PEP requires that the assignment target be explicitly
indicated as local before the first use as a ``:=`` target, either by
binding it to a value (as shown above), or else by including an appropriate
explicit type declaration::

    m : typing.re.Match
    if m := pattern.match(data):
        ...
    elif m := other_pattern.match(data):
        ...
    elif m := yet_another_pattern.match(data):
        ...
    else:
        ...


Capturing intermediate values from comprehensions
-------------------------------------------------

The proposal in this PEP makes it straightforward to capture and reuse
intermediate values in comprehensions and generator expressions by
exporting them to the containing block scope::

    factor = 1
    while any(n % (factor := p) == 0 for p in small_primes):
        n //= factor

    def cumulative_sums(data, start=0)
       total = start
       yield from (total += value for value in data)
       return total


Allowing lambda expressions to act more like re-usable code thunks
------------------------------------------------------------------

This PEP allows the closure-based counter example::

    def make_counter(start=0):
        x = start
        def counter(step=1):
            nonlocal x
            x += step
            return x
        return counter

To be abbreviated as::

    def make_counter(start=0):
        x = start
        return (lambda step=1: x += step)

While the latter form is still a conceptually dense piece of code, it can be
reasonably argued that the lack of boilerplate (where the "def", "nonlocal",
and "return" keywords and two additional repetitions of the "x" variable name
have been replaced with the "lambda" keyword) may make it easier to read in
practice.


Acknowledgements
================

The PEP author wishes to thank Chris Angelico for his work on PEP 572, and his
efforts to create a coherent summary of the great many sprawling discussions
that spawned on both python-ideas and python-dev, as well as Tim Peters for
the in-depth discussion of parent local scoping that prompted the above
scoping proposal for augmented assignments inside scoped expressions.

Eric Snow's feedback on a pre-release version of this PEP helped make it
significantly more readable.
