Abstract
========

It is proposed to support ``__getattr__`` function defined on modules to
provide basic customization of module attribute access.


Rationale
=========

It is sometimes convenient to customize or otherwise have control over
access to module attributes. A typical example is managing deprecation
warnings. Typical workarounds are assigning ``__class__`` of a module object
to a custom subclass of ``types.ModuleType`` or substituting ``sys.modules``
item with a custom wrapper instance. It would be convenient to simplify this
procedure by recognizing ``__getattr__`` defined directly in a module that
would act like a normal ``__getattr__`` method, except that it will be defined
on module *instances*. For example::

  # lib.py

  from warnings import warn

  deprecated_names = ["old_function", ...]

  def _deprecated_old_function(arg, other):
      ...

  def __getattr__(name):
      if name in deprecated_names:
          warn(f"{name} is deprecated", DeprecationWarning)
          return globals()["_deprecated_" + name]
      raise AttributeError(f"module {__name__} has no attribute {name}")

  # main.py

  from lib import old_function  # Works, but emits the warning

There is a related proposal PEP 549 that proposes to support instance
properties for a similar functionality. The difference is this PEP proposes
a faster and simpler mechanism, but provides more basic customization.
An additional motivation for this proposal is that PEP 484 already defines
the use of module ``__getattr__`` for a this purpose in Python stub files,
see [1]_.


Specification
=============

The ``__getattr__`` function at the module level should accept one argument
which is a name of an attribute and return the computed value or raise
an ``AttributeError``::

  def __getattr__(name: str) -> Any: ...

This function will be called only if ``name`` is not found in the module
through the normal attribute lookup.

The reference implementation for this PEP can be found in [2]_.


Backwards compatibility and impact on performance
=================================================

This PEP will break the code that uses module level (global) name
``__getattr__``. The performance implications of this PEP are minimal, since
``__getattr__`` is called only for missing attributes.
