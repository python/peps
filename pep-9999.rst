Abstract
========

Unique placeholder values, widely known as "sentinel values", are useful in
Python programs for several things, such as default values for function
arguments where ``None`` is a valid input value.  These cases are common
enough for several idioms for implementing such "sentinels" to have arisen
over the years, but uncommon enough that there hasn't been a clear need for
standardization.  However, the common implementations, including some in the
stdlib, suffer from several significant drawbacks.

This PEP suggests adding a utility for defining sentinel values, to be used
in the stdlib and made publicly available as part of the stdlib.

Note: Changing all existing sentinels in the stdlib to be implemented this
way is not deemed necessary, and whether to do so is left to the discretion
of each maintainer.


Motivation
==========

In May 2021, a question was brought up on the python-dev mailing list
[#python-dev-thread]_ about how to better implement a sentinel value for
``traceback.print_exception``.  The existing implementation used the
following common idiom:

::

    _sentinel = object()

However, this object has an overly verbose repr, causing the function's
signature to be overly long and hard to read, as seen e.g. when calling
``help()``:

::

    >>> help(traceback.print_exception)
    Help on function print_exception in module traceback:

    print_exception(exc, /, value=<object object at
    0x000002825DF09650>, tb=<object object at 0x000002825DF09650>,
    limit=None, file=None, chain=True)

Additionally, two other drawbacks of many existing sentinels were brought up
in the discussion:

1. Not having a distinct type, hence it being impossible to define strict
   type signatures functions with sentinels as default values
2. Incorrect behavior after being copied or unpickled, due to a separate
   instance being created and thus comparisons using ``is`` failing

In the ensuing discussion, Victor Stinner supplied a list of currently used
sentinel values in the Python standard library [#list-of-sentinels-in-stdlib]_.
This showed that the need for sentinels is fairly common, that there are
various implementation methods used even within the stdlib, and that many of
these suffer from at least one of the aforementioned drawbacks.

The discussion did not lead to any clear consensus on whether a standard
implementation method is needed or desirable, whether the drawbacks mentioned
are significant, nor which kind of implementation would be good.

A poll was created on discuss.python.org [#poll]_ to get a clearer sense of the
community's opinions. As of this writing (May 21st 2021) the poll's results
are not conclusive, with 41% of voters voting for "Consistent use of a new,
dedicated sentinel factory / class / meta-class, also made publicly available
in the stdlib", but 41% also voting for "The status-quo is fine / there’s no
need for consistency in this".

With such mixed opinions, this PEP was created to facilitate making a decision
on the subject.


Rationale
=========

The criteria guiding the chosen implementation were:

1. The sentinel objects should behave as expected by a sentinel object: When
   compared using the ``is`` operator, it should always be considered identical
   to itself but never to any other object.
2. It should be simple to define as many distinct sentinel values as needed.
3. The sentinel objects should have a clear and short repr.
4. The sentinel objects should each have a *distinct* type, usable in type
   annotations to define *strict* type signatures.
5. The sentinel objects should behave correctly after copying and/or
   unpickling.
6. Creating a sentinel object should be a simple, straightforward one-liner.
7. Works using CPython and PyPy3.  Will hopefully also work with other
   implementations.

After researching existing idioms and implementations, and going through many
different possible implementations, an implementation was written which meets
all of these criteria (see `Reference Implementation`_).


Specification
=============

A new ``sentinel`` function will be added to a new ``sentinels`` module.
It will accept a single required argument, the name of the sentinel object,
and a single optional argument, the repr of the object.

::

    >>> NotGiven = sentinel('NotGiven')
    >>> NotGiven
    <NotGiven>
    >>> MISSING = sentinel('MISSING', repr='mymodule.MISSING')
    >>> MISSING
    mymodule.MISSING


A third optional argument, the name of the module where the sentinel is
defined, exists to be used to support cases where the name of the module
cannot be found by inspecting the stack frame.  This is identical to the
pattern used by ``collections.namedtuple``.  (The name of the module is
used to choose a unique name for the class generated for the new sentinel,
which is set as an attribute of the ``sentinels`` module.)


Reference Implementation
========================

The reference implementation is found in a dedicated GitHub repo
[#reference-github-repo]_.  A simplified version follows::

    def sentinel(name, repr=None):
        """Create a unique sentinel object."""
        repr = repr or f'<{name}>'

        module = _get_parent_frame().f_globals.get('__name__', '__main__')
        class_name = _get_class_name(name, module)
        class_namespace = {
            '__repr__': lambda self: repr,
        }
        cls = type(class_name, (), class_namespace)
        cls.__module__ = __name__
        globals()[class_name] = cls

        sentinel = cls()
        cls.__new__ lambda cls: sentinel

        return sentinel

    def _get_class_name(sentinel_qualname, module_name):
        return '__'.join(['_sentinel_type',
                          module_name.replace('.', '_'),
                          sentinel_qualname.replace('.', '_')])


Rejected Ideas
==============


Use ``NotGiven = object()``
---------------------------

This suffers from all of the drawbacks mentioned in the `Rationale`_ section.


Add a single new sentinel value, e.g. ``MISSING`` or ``Sentinel``
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Since such a value could be used for various things in various places, one
could not always be confident that it would never be a valid value in some use
cases.  On the other hand, a dedicated and distinct sentinel value can be used
with confidence without needing to consider potential edge-cases.

Additionally, it is useful to be able to provide a meaningful name and repr
for a sentinel value, specific to the context where it is used.

Finally, this was a very unpopular option in the poll, with only 12% of
the votes voting for it.


Use the existing ``Ellipsis`` sentinel value
--------------------------------------------

This is not the original intended use of Ellipsis, though it has become
increasingly common to use it to define empty class or function blocks instead
of using ``pass``.

Also, similar to a potential new single sentinel value, ``Ellipsis`` can't be
as confidently used in all cases, unlike a dedicated, distinct value.


Use a single-valued enum
------------------------

The suggested idiom is:

::

    class NotGivenType(Enum):
        NotGiven = 'NotGiven'
    NotGiven = NotGivenType.NotGiven

Besides the excessive repetition, the repr is overly long:
``<NotGivenType.NotGiven: 'NotGiven'>``.  A shorter repr can be defined, at
the expense of a bit more code and yet more repetition.

Finally, this option was the least popular among the nine options in the poll
[#poll]_, being the only option to receive no votes.


A sentinel class decorator
--------------------------

The suggested interface:

::

    @sentinel(repr='<NotGiven>')
    class NotGivenType: pass
    NotGiven = NotGivenType()

While this allowed for a very simple and clear implementation, the interface
is too verbose, repetitive, and difficult to remember.


Using class objects
-------------------

Since classes are inherently singletons, using a class as a sentinel value
makes sense and allows for a simple implementation.

The simplest version of this idiom is:

::

   class NotGiven: pass

To have a clear repr, one could define ``__repr__``:

::

    class NotGiven:
        def __repr__(self):
            return '<NotGiven>'

... or use a meta-class:

::

    class NotGiven(metaclass=SentinelMeta): pass

However, all such implementations don't have a dedicated type for the
sentinel, which is considered desirable.  A dedicated type could be created
by a meta-class or class decorator, but at that point the implementation would
become much more complex and loses its advantages over the chosen
implementation.

Additionally, using classes this way is unusual and could be confusing.


Define a recommended "standard" idiom, without supplying an implementation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Most common exiting idioms have significant drawbacks.  So far, no idiom
has been found that is clear and concise while avoiding these drawbacks.

Also, in the poll on this subject [#poll]_, the options for recommending an
idiom were unpopular, with the highest-voted option being voted for by only
25% of the voters.


Additional Notes
================

* This PEP and the initial implementation are drafted in a dedicated GitHub
  repo [#reference-github-repo]_.

* The support for copying/unpickling works when defined in a module's scope or
  a (possibly nested) class's scope.  Note that in the latter case, the name
  provided as the first parameter must be the fully-qualified name of the
  variable in the module::

      class MyClass:
          NotGiven = sentinel('MyClass.NotGiven', repr='<NotGiven>')
