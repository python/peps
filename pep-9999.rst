Abstract
========

This PEP proposes to extend the string formatting syntax to support a
fixed-point format specifier using locale-aware grouping and decimal
place characters.


Rationale
=========

Python already supports adding thousands separators (grouping) in a non-locale
aware manner via the ``,`` [1]_ and ``_`` [2]_ modifiers, as well as a locale
aware format type ``n`` that uses locale aware grouping for thousands
separators but will render large numbers using exponential notation.

Exponential notation is not approprate for many applications including
financial software, where grouping would increase the legibility of a
number presented to the user.

While it is possible to use the existing grouping modifiers to format a
number and subsequently replace the separators with the appropriate values
as per the locale data, this does not address locales where the grouping may
not occur every three digits.

Finally, there exists ``locale.format_string()`` [3]_ but this is built upon
%-formatting which will coerce ``Decimal`` values to floating point and can
result in incorrect results for values which cannot accurately be represented
by the floating point format.


Proposal
========

A single-quote would be added to the format() specifier mini-language and
could be used in place of the comma or underscore. The presence of this
character will enable locale specific grouping as well as the locale specific
decimal point character.

This modifier can be combined with the 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'E', 'G', '%' and
'F' types.

Examples
--------

    >>> locale.setlocale(locale.LC_ALL, 'en_US')
    >>> format(12345, "'f")
    12,345
    >>> format(12345.67, "'f")
    12,345.000000
    >>> format(12345.67, "'.2f")
    12,345.67

    >>> locale.setlocale(locale.LC_ALL, 'de_DE')
    >>> format(12345, "'f")
    12.345
    >>> format(12345.67, "'.2f")
    12.345,67
    >>> format(12345.67, "'.2e")
    1,23e+4


Prior Art
=========

The use of ``'`` for this purpose is already the established practice as per
the Single UNIX Specification as is implemented for printf() in glibc and
others. [4]_


Draft Implementation
====================

A draft implementation for the Decimal type is currently available in PR 8612. [5]_

Another implementation created independently is also available as PR 11405. [6]_

Monetary vs Non-Monetary Formats
================================

There are a very small number of locales that differentiate between the format
of monetary (``LC_MONETARY``) and non-monetary (``LC_NUMERIC``) values. The
C99 specification does not appear to offer any mechanism to indicate that
monetary formatting is required, and thus this implementation also omits
monetary formats.


Alternative Proposals
=====================

A number of other suggestions for the actual format character or modifier have
been suggested:

  * My original implementation used ``l`` (non-monetary) and ``L`` (monetary)
    format characters

  * The alternate implementation in PR 11405 uses ``m`` format character

  * Stefan Krah proposed the use of ``$n``
