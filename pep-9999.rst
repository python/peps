Abstract
========

This document describes extensions to the build backend-frontend communication
(as introduced by `PEP-517`_) to allow projects to be installed in editable
mode.

Motivation
==========

Python programmers want to be able to develop packages without having to
install them after every change. Installing a project is made up of
building a wheel from the source directory (as described by `PEP-517`_
and `PEP-518`_) and then install that wheel into a python environment.

Currently users can achieve this by:

- Adding the relevant source directories to ``sys.path`` (configurable from the
  command line interface via the ``PYTHONPATH`` environment variable). Note in
  this case the user have to install the project dependencies themselves and
  entry points or project metadata are not generated.
- `setuptools`_ provides the `setup.py develop`_ mechanism: installs a
  ``pth`` file that injects the project root onto the ``sys.path``
  at interpreter startup time, generates the project metadata and also installs
  project dependencies. `pip`_ exposes calling this mechanism via the
  `pip install -e <project_directory>`_ command line interface.
- `flit`_ provides the `flit install --symlink`_ command that: symlinks the
  project files into the interpreters ``purelib`` folder, generates the project
  metadata and also installs dependencies.

The installation of a project in a way that the code being imported and
executed remains in the source directory is known as the *editable*
installation mode. This mode allows the user to change the code and run it
without needing to reinstall it after every change.

The goal of this PEP is to provide a standardized interface between the build
frontend and backends for building and installing projects in editable mode.
This will allow backends to expose the project in editable mode, and for the
frontends a way to request this, in a generic mode for all build backend and
frontends. The PEP also proposes on not imposing any editable mode onto the
packaging tool the user communicates with (and in turn which uses the build
frontend to communicate with the build backend).

Rationale
=========

`PEP-517`_ deferred "Editable installs" because this would have delayed further
its adoption and there wasn't an agreement how editable installs should be
achieved. Due to the propularity of the `setuptools`_ and `pip`_ projects
the status quo prevailed, and backends could achieve editable mode by providing
a ``setup.py develop`` implementation, which the user could trigger via
`pip install -e <project_directory>`_. By definining an editable interface
between build backend and frontends we can totally eliminate the need of the
``setup.py`` file and communication method.

Terminology and goals
=====================

The editable installation mode implies that the source code of the project
being installed is available in a local directory.

Once the project is installed in editable mode, users expect that changes to
the project code in the local source tree become effective without the need of
a new installation step.

Some kind of changes, such as the addition or modification of entry points, or
the addition of new dependencies, require a new installation step to become
effective. These changes are typically made in build backend configuration
files (such as ``pyproject.toml``), so it is consistent with the general user
expectation that source code is imported from the source tree.

When a project is installed in editable mode, users expect the installation to
behave identically as a regular installation. Depending on the way build build
frontends implement this specification, some minor differences may be visible,
such as the presence of additional files (compared to a regular installation)
either in the source tree or the interpreters installation path. Both the build
backend and frontends are encouraged to document such potential differences.

For reference a non editable installation works as follows:

1. The **developer** is using a tool, we'll call it here the **orchestrator**
   to drive the project development (e.g., `pip`_). When the user wants to
   trigger a package build and install of a project they'll communicate with
   the **orchestrator**.
2. The orchestrator uses a **build frontend** to trigger build of a wheel
   (e.g., `build`_). The build frontend uses `PEP-517`_ to communicate with the
   **build backend** (e.g. `setuptools`_) - with the build backend installed
   into an isolated environment. Once invoked the backend returns a wheel.
3. The orchestrator takes the wheel and feeds it to an **installer** (e.g.,
   `installer`_) to install the wheel into the target python interpreter.

The Mechanism
=============

This PEP adds two optional hooks to the `PEP-517`_ backend interface. One of
the hooks is used to specify the build dependencies of an editable install, and
the other hook returns the necessary information via the build frontend the
orchestrator needs to create an editable install.

get_requires_for_build_editable
-------------------------------

:: 

  def build_editable(config_settings=None):
      ...

This hook MUST return an additional list of strings containing `PEP-508`_
dependency specifications, above and beyond those specified in the
``pyproject.toml`` file. These dependencies will be installed when calling the
``build_editable`` hook.

If not defined, the default implementation is equivalent to return ``[]``.

build_editable
--------------

:: 

  def build_editable(config_settings=None):
      ...

The function returns an object of type ``EditableInfo`` as defined below:

::

  from types import ModuleType
  from typing import Protocol, TypedDict


  class RequiredEditableInfo(TypedDict, total=True):
      metadata_for_build_editable: str
      """distribution information of the package as defined by PEP-491"""

  class EditableInfo(RequiredEditableInfo, total=False):
      sys_paths: list[str]
      """folders that should be inserted at the start of the sys.path"""

      purelib_paths: list[str]
      """files or folders that should be available under the purelib"""

      platlib_paths: list[str]
      """files or folders that should be available under the platlib"""

      import_callback: ImportCallback | None
      """a function to execute whenever a module is to be imported"""

  class ImportCallback(TypedDict, total=True):
      module: str
      """the module containing the callback"""
      
      func: str
      """the function to serve as a callback, of type CallbackFunc"""

  class CallbackFunc(Protocol):
      def __call__(self, name) -> ModuleType | None:
          """
          :param name: the module name to import
          :returns: the module if it can import, otherwise None
          """


Build frontend requirements
---------------------------

The build frontend is responsible of setting up the environment for the build
backend to generate the build editable information. It's also responsible of
communicating with the backend and receiving the ``EditableInfo`` object. All
recommendations from `PEP-517`_ for the build wheel hook applies here too.

Orchestrator requirements
-------------------------

It's the responsibility of the orchestrator to achieve the editable
functionality. The orchestrator should provide (one or more) mechanisms
depending on the amount of data the backend provides and communicate directly
with the user about which to select.

The orchestrator is repsonsible of making sure the ``.dist-info`` folder is
available at runtime within the target interpreter for the `importlib.metadata`
and `importlib.resources` modules.

The orchestrator must ensure that all install requirements (and should the user
require any extra groups) are installed part of the editable build into the
target interpreter.

The orchestrator must ensure that console or gui entrypoints are generated
during the editable installation, just as they would be should the
``.dist-info`` come as part of a wheel.

Build backends that provide an import hoook functionality are required to
provision the code to their import hooks either via the ``platlib_paths``, 
``purelib_paths`` or install requirements injected just for the editable
build installs.

The orchestrator is responsible of generating the RECORD file, based on the
object the build backend returns and their choosen editable implementation. Due
to this uninstallation of editables should not require any special treatment.

The orchestrator must create a ``direct_url.json`` file in the ``.dist-info``
directory of the installed distribution, in compliance with PEP 610. The
``url`` value must be a ``file://`` url pointing to the project directory
(i.e. the directory containing ``pyproject.toml``), and the ``dir_info`` value
must be ``{'editable': true}``.

The orchestrator must not rely on the ``prepare_metadata_for_build_wheel`` hook
when installing in editable mode. They must use ``build_editable`` and use the
``.dist-info`` folder returned by that.

If the import hook is provided by the backend the orchestrator should register
a hook into the import system at interpreter startup and make sure the hook is called
before any other import mechanisms are attempted.

The import hook will be called during the import discovery mechanism of the
target interpreter and there are no guarantees related to the current working
guarantee or environment variables. The build backend should generate an import
hook that does not really on the value of these states.

Should the orchestrator be unable to create an editable installation with the
set of information returned by the build backend it's free to raise an error
to the user.

Example editable mode implementations
-------------------------------------

Achieving an editable mode can be done in multiple ways by the orchestrator.
We'll present a few examples of these here, note however the orchestrators
are encouraged to come up with new ways if needed.

Alter ``sys.path`` at interpreter startup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is what `setuptools`_ does with the generation of the ``pth`` file into
the interpreters ``purelib``. This solution is very fast and cross platform
compatible, however puts the entire source tree onto the system, potentially
exposing modules that would not be available in a normal installation case.

This mode is what `pip install -e <project_directory>`_ currently resolves to.
It requires the build backend to provide a folder to expose, and the
orchestrator to insert that path onto the ``sys.path`` at interpreter startup.

With this PEP the build backend would return:

::

    {
      "metadata_for_build_editable": "<dir to dist-info>",
      "sys_paths": ["<project dir>"]
    }

The orchestrator then could generate a ``pth`` file to insert ``<project dir>``
onto the ``sys.path`` at startup, and similarly with the parent of the
distribution information.

Symlink the source code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is what flit does via its `flit install --symlink`_. This solution
requires the current platform to support symlinks, but allows potentially to
symlink not folders, but also andividual files, which could solve the problem
of exposing files that otherwise would not be exposed.

This mode requires the build backend to provides one or more folder(s)/file(s)
to expose, and the orchestrator to to symlink them.

With this PEP the build backend would return:

::

  {
    "metadata_for_build_editable": "<dir to dist-info>",
    "purelib_paths": ["<module_file>", "<package_folder>"]
  }

The orchestrator then could generate symlinks into the ``purelib`` folder of
the target interpreter for the ``.dist-info`` folder and all file/folders
within the ``purelib_paths``. Note should the orchestrator wish they could
use ``pth`` files with this set of information too.

Import hook
~~~~~~~~~~~

Import hooks allow stronger collaboration between the build backend and the
target interpreter. We'll go over a few such use cases here.

Expose a source folder, but honour module excludes: the backend may generate
an import hook that consults the exclusion table before allowing a source
file loader to discover a file in the source directory or not.

For a project let there be two modules ``A.py`` and ``B.py``, these are two
separate files in the source direcotry, however during building a wheel they
are merged into one megafile ``project.py``. In this case with this PEP 
the backend could generate an import hook that reads the source files at
import time and merges them in-memory before materializing it as a module.

Automatically update out of date C-extensions: the backend may generate an
import hook that checks the last modified timestamp for a C-extension source
file, and if it is greater than the current C-extension binary trigger an
update by calling the compiler before import.

Rejected ideas
==============

This PEP competes with ``PEP-660``, and rejects that proposal because we think
the mechanism of achieving an editable installation should be within the build
frontend rather than the build backend. Furthermore, this approach allows for
the ecosystem to use alternative mechanisms to achieve the editable install
effect (e.g., insert path on ``sys.path`` or symlinks instead of implying just
the loose wheel mode from the backends described by that PEP).
