Abstract
========

This PEP proposes a governnance model with as few procedures, defined terms and
percentages as possible. It may also be called *The Anarchist Governance Model*
but uses *Commons* for now because of possible negative connotations of the
term *Anarchist* to some audiences.

The rationale for the model is that everything that is cast in concrete will
have unintended negative side effects. For example, a governance model that
assigns voting rights to, say, Python committers may cause individuals not
to be accepted as a committer because there are already a lot of committers
from the company the new candidate works for. As another example, setting
a fixed percentage for PEP acceptance may lead to party-formation amongst
the voters and individual PEPs no longer be being judged on individual merit
but along party lines (if you support my PEP I will support yours).
