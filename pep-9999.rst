Abstract
========

Initially PEP 484 was designed in such way that it would not introduce
*any* changes to the core CPython interpreter. Now that type hints and
the ``typing`` module are extensively used by the community, this restriction
can be removed. It is proposed to add two special methods
``__class_getitem__`` and ``__subclass_base__`` to the core CPython for
better support of generic types.


Rationale
=========

The restriction to not modify the core CPython interpreter lead to some
design decisions that became questionable when the ``typing`` module started
to be widely used. There are three main points of concerns:
performance of the ``typing`` module, metaclass conflicts, and large amount
of hacks currently used in ``typing``.


Performance:
------------

The ``typing`` module is one of the heaviest and slowest modules in
the standard library even with all the optimizations made. Mainly this is
because subscripted generic types (see PEP 484 for definition of terms
used in this PEP) are class objects (see also [1]_). The three main ways how
the performance can be improved with the help of the proposed special methods:

- Creation of generic classes is slow since the ``GenericMeta.__new__`` is
  very slow, we will not need it anymore.

- Very long MROs for generic classes will be twice shorter, they are present
  because we duplicate the ``collections.abc`` inheritance chain
  in ``typing``.

- Time of instantiation of generic classes will be improved
  (this is minor however).


Metaclass conflicts:
--------------------

All generic types are instances of ``GenericMeta``, so if a user uses
a custom metaclass, then it is hard to make a corresponding class generic.
This is particularly hard for library classes that a user doesn't control.
A workaround is to always mix-in ``GenericMeta``::

  class AdHocMeta(GenericMeta, LibraryMeta):
      pass

  class UserClass(LibraryBase, Generic[T], metaclass=AdHocMeta):
      ...

but this is not always practical or even possible. With the help of the
proposed special attributes the ``GenericMeta`` metaclass will not be needed.


Hacks and bugs that will be removed by this proposal:
-----------------------------------------------------

- ``_generic_new`` hack that exists since ``__init__`` is not called on
  instances with a type differing form the type whose ``__new__`` was called,
  ``C[int]().__class__ is C``.

- ``_next_in_mro`` speed hack will be not necessary since subscription will
  not create new classes.

- Ugly ``sys._getframe`` hack, this one is particularly nasty, since it looks
  like we can't remove it without changes outside ``typing``.

- Currently generics do dangerous things with private ABC caches
  to fix large memory consumption that grows at least as O(N\ :sup:`2`),
  see [2]_. This point is also important because it was recently proposed to
  re-implement ``ABCMeta`` in C.

- Problems with sharing attributes between subscripted generics,
  see [3]_. Current solution already uses ``__getattr__`` and ``__setattr__``,
  but it is still incomplete, and solving this without the current proposal
  will be hard and will need ``__getattribute__``.

- ``_no_slots_copy`` hack, where we clean-up the class dictionary on every
  subscription thus allowing generics with ``__slots__``.

- General complexity of the ``typing`` module, the new proposal will not
  only allow to remove the above mentioned hacks/bugs, but also simplify
  the implementation, so that it will be easier to maintain.


Specification
=============

Idea of ``__class_getitem__`` is very simple, it is an exact analog of
``__getitem__`` with an exception that it is called on a class that
defines it, not on its instances, this allows us to avoid
``GenericMeta.__getitem__`` for things like ``Iterable[int]``. Note that this
method is used as a fallback, so if a metaclass defines ``__getitem__``,
then it will have the priority.

If an object that is not a class object appears in bases of a class
definition, the ``__subclass_base__`` is searched on it. If found,
it is given an original tuple of bases as an argument. If the result of call
is not ``None``, then it is substituted instead of this object.
Otherwise, the base is just removed. This is necessary to avoid
inconsistent MRO errors, that are currently prevented by manipulations in
``GnericMeta.__new__``. After creating the class, original bases are saved
in ``__orig_bases__`` (now this is also done by the metaclass).

These two method names are reserved for exclusive use by the ``typing`` module
and the generic types machinery, and any other use is strongly discouraged.
The reference implementation (with tests) can be found in [4]_, the proposal
was originally posted and discussed on the ``typing`` tracker, see [5]_.


Backwards compatibility and impact on users who don't use ``typing``:
=====================================================================

This proposal will break code that currently uses the names
``__class_getitem__`` and ``__subclass_base__``.

This proposal will allow to have almost full backwards compatibility with
current public generic types API, moreover the ``typing`` module is still
provisional.

With the reference implementation I measured negligible performance effects
(under 1%) for regular (non-generic) classes.
