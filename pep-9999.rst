Abstract
========

This PEP describes the changes between versions 2.1 and 2.2 of the core
metadata specification for Python packages. Version 2.1 is specified in PEP
566.

The key and only change introduced in this PEP is how license is documented in
package medata.

Software is licensed and providing accurate licensing information to Python
packages users is an important matter.  Yet, license metadata are limited often
leading to some confusion. 

- There are two overlapping places where a license can be documented leading to
  confusion for packagers: license-related `Classifiers` and the `License`
  attribute.

- Furthermore, it is difficult to convey anything but simple licensing using
  these two fields. License information expressiveness and clarity when creating
  packages will help packagers and users alike.

License expressions provide a better way to express the license of a
distribution using a well defined syntax and well known license ids from SPDX.

This PEP was started based on several discussions and in particular:

- `<https://github.com/pypa/warehouse/issues/2996>`_
- `<https://github.com/pypa/interoperability-peps/issues/46>`_
- `<https://github.com/pypa/packaging-problems/issues/41>`_
- `<https://github.com/pypa/wheel/issues/138>`_
- `<https://github.com/pombredanne/spdx-pypi-pep/issues/1#issuecomment-281343077>`_


Fields
======

The canonical source for the names and semantics of each of the supported
metadata fields is the `Core Metadata Specification`_ document.

The details for the update to the `Core Metadata Specification`_ document are 
in this `Core Metadata Specification pull request`_.


New in Version 2.2
------------------

License-Expression (optional)
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

A string containing a license expression using the SPDX license expression
syntax and SPDX-listed license identifiers so that user can express accurately
the licensing of a package in a way that is both easy to read for humans and
easy to process automatically by tools.

A string containing a license expression using `SPDX license expression syntax and
identifiers <https://spdx.org/ids>`__ that indicates the license(s) covering the
distribution. The license expressions are specified in the `SPDX specification 
<https://spdx.org/spdx-specification-21-web-version#h.jxpfx0ykyb60>`_.
SPDX also publishes a companion `list of license ids <https://spdx.org/license-list>`_
for use in license expressions. 

Note: this field is not case sensitive though the normalized representation of
an SPDX license expression has a well defined case.

Examples::

    License-Expression: BSD-3-Clause

    License-Expression: MIT OR GPL-2.0-or-later AND (FSFUL AND BSD-2-Clause)

    License-Expression: GPL-3.0-or-later WITH Classpath-Exception-2.0 OR BSD-3-Clause


Tools `should` validate that this field contains a valid license expression
and `should` report a warning if the field contains an invalid expression.


Changed in Version 2.2
----------------------

License
:::::::

This field will be deprecated in the future and its documentation has been
updated accordingly. Tools are encouraged to provide a warning when this field
is used.

Classifiers
:::::::::::

The use of license-related classifiers in this field will be deprecated in the
future and its documentation has been updated accordingly. Tools are encouraged
to provide a warning when this field is used with license-related classifiers.


Summary of Differences From PEP 566
===================================

* Metadata-Version is now 2.2.

* Added one new field: ``License-Expression``

* Updated the documentation of two fields:  ``License`` and ``Classifiers``
