Abstract
========

This PEP proposes adding a mechanism for deep immutability to
Python. The mechanism requires some changes to the core language,
but user-facing functions are delivered in a module called
``immutable``. This module provides the following functions and types:

1. The function ``freeze(obj)`` -- turns ``obj`` deeply immutable
2. The function ``isfrozen(obj)`` -- returns ``True`` if ``obj`` is immutable
3. The function ``isfreezable(obj)`` -- returns ``True`` if all objects reachable from ``obj`` can be frozen
4. The type ``NotFreezable`` which is an empty type which cannot be frozen and can be used as a super class to classes whose instances should not be freezable
5. The type ``NotFreezableError`` which is raised on an attempt to mutate an immutable object
6. The function ``register_freezable(type)`` -- which is used to whitelist types implemented as C extensions, permitting their instances to be frozen

Making an object *deeply* immutable recursively renders the object
*and all objects it references* immutable. (Just
making the first object immutable is called *shallow*
immutability.)

Deep immutability provides strong guarantees against
unintended modifications, thereby improving correctness, security, and
parallel execution safety.

Immutable objects are managed with reference counting plus cycle
detection just like normal mutable objects, and can be made
immortal. In this PEP, we rely on the GIL to ensure the
correctness of reference counts of immutable objects, but we have
several planned memory management extensions, including support
for atomic reference counting on immutable objects. These are
outlined at the end of this document.

Immutability in action:

.. code-block:: python

  from immutable import freeze, isfrozen

  class Foo:
      pass

  f = Foo()
  g = Foo()
  h = Foo()

  f.f = g
  g.f = h
  h.f = g # cycles are OK!
  del g # Remove local ref to g, so g's RC = 1
  del h # Remove local reg to h, so h's RC = 1

  g.x = "African Swallow" # OK
  freeze(f) # Makes, f, g and h immutable
  g.x = "European Swallow" # Throws an exception "g is immutable"
  isfrozen(h) # returns True
  h = None # Cycle detector will eventually find and collect the cycle


Motivation
==========


Ensuring Data Integrity
-----------------------

Python programs frequently manipulate large, interconnected data
structures such as dictionaries, lists, and user-defined objects.
Unintentional mutations can introduce subtle and
difficult-to-debug errors. By allowing developers to explicitly
freeze objects and their transitive dependencies, Python can
provide stronger correctness guarantees for data processing
pipelines, functional programming paradigms, and API boundaries
where immutability is beneficial.


Immutable Objects can be Freely Shared Without Risk of Data Races
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Python’s Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) mitigates many data race
issues, but as Python evolves towards improved multi-threading and
parallel execution (e.g., subinterpreters and the free-threaded Python
efforts), data races on shared mutable objects become a more
pressing concern. A deep immutability mechanism ensures that
shared objects are not modified concurrently, enabling safer
multi-threaded and parallel computation. Safe sharing of immutable
objects across multiple threads require deep immutability.
Consider the following example:

.. code-block:: python

  import threading

  data = [1, 2, 4, 8]
  length = len(data)
  pair = (data, length)

  threading.Thread(target=print, args=(pair,)).start()

  del data[2]

The shallow immutability of the ``pair`` tuple prevents the
``data`` list from being swapped for another list, but the list
itself is not immutable. Thus, the ``print`` function in the newly
spawned thread will be racing with the deletion. In Python 3.12,
this is not a problem as the GIL prevents this race. To ensure
`container thread-safety
<https://peps.python.org/pep-0703/#container-thread-safety>`_, PEP
703 proposes per-object locks instead. If ``pair`` was frozen, the
deletion would have caused an error.

The following image illustrates that as soon as an object *a*
is reachable by two threads, then all other objects that
*a* can reach are also reachable by both threads. The dashed
red references to *c* and *d* are not possible because then
*c* and *d* would not be in areas where only a single thread
could reach them.

To map the code example above to the figure -- ``pair`` is *a* and ``list`` is *b*.

See also the discussion about extensions further down in this
document.

Deep immutability can be implemented efficiently. An alternative approach
would be to detect data-races using a read-barrier based approach, however,
this cannot be implemented as efficiently. We discuss this in the alternatives
section. As highlighted above, immutability also has value in single-threaded
application, i.e. where there is no fear of data races.


Optimisations and Caching Benefits
----------------------------------

Immutable objects provide opportunities for optimisation, such as
structural sharing, memoization, and just-in-time (JIT)
compilation techniques (specialising for immutable data, e.g.
fixed shape, fewer barriers, inlining, etc.). Freezing objects can
allow Python to implement more efficient caching mechanisms and
enable compiler optimisations that rely on immutability
assumptions. This PEP will permit such opportunities to go
beyond today's immutable objects (like ``int``, ``string``) and
*shallow* immutable objects (``tuple``, ``frozenset``).



Specification
=============

Note: our current prototype implementation was authored on-top of
Python 3.12. To avoid blocking on rebasing on 3.14 to force
decisions about changes to implementation detail, we are
circulating this document to discuss the design ideas,
and some of the unaffected aspects of the implementation.

An outline of the changes that we anticipate are required for
Python 3.14 is can be found at the `end of the document <Rebasing on Python 3.14>`_.


Changes to Python Objects
-------------------------

Every Python object will have a flag that keeps track of its
immutability status. Details about the default value of
this flag is discussed further down in this document. 

The flag can be added without extending the size of the
Python object header.


Implementation of Immutability
------------------------------

Immutability is enforced through run-time checking. The macro
``Py_CHECKWRITE(op)`` is inserted on all paths that are guaranteed
to end up in a write to ``op``. The macro inspects the immutability
flag in the header of ``op`` and signals an error if the immutability
flag is set.

A typical use of this check looks like this:

.. code-block:: c

  if (!Py_CHECKWRITE(op)) {        // perform the check
      PyErr_WriteToImmutable(op);  // raise the error if the check fails
      return NULL;                 // abort the write
  }  
  ... // code that performs the write


Writes are common in the CPython code base and the writes lack a
common "code path" that they pass. To this end, the PEP requires a
``Py_CHECKWRITE`` call to be inserted and there are several places
in the CPython code base that are changed as a consequence of this
PEP. So far we have identified around 70 places in core Python which
needed a ``Py_CHECKWRITE`` check. Modules in the standard library
have required somewhere between 5 and 15 checks per module.


Backward Compatibility
======================

This proposal intends to be fully backward compatible, as no existing Python
code will be affected unless it explicitly calls ``freeze(obj)``.
Frozen objects will raise errors only when mutation is attempted.


Opt-In vs. Opt-Out
------------------

All pure Python objects can be frozen, provided all their members
and their base classes can be frozen. However, for types which
are partially or completely implemented in C, support for
immutability requires some work on both exposing objects to
freezing, and to enforce immutability in mutating C-functions.

From a backwards compatibility perspective, an opt-in model keeps
things simple: all existing code keeps working, and only code that
wishes to support immutability needs updating. The downside of the
opt-in model is that a large part of all Python libraries cannot
be (even nominally) frozen.

This PEP proposes to make support for immutability in C extensions
and Python wrappers of classes which would otherwise not be freezable
opt-in through a whitelisting mechanism implemented through the
function ``register_freezable(type)`` in the ``immutable`` module.

Note that it is possible to mix modules and types that support
immutability with those that do not, as long as this does not
breaks strictness.


Strictness
----------

A strict interpretation of deep immutability does not permit an
immutable object to reference a mutable object. This model is both
easy to explain and understand, and an object's immutability can
be "trusted" --- it is not possible for an immutable object to
change through some nested mutable state [#RC]_. At the same time
it limits the utility of freezing as many Python objects contain
types outside of the standard library defined in C, which must
opt-in immutability before they can be frozen.

This PEP proposes immutability to be strict.


Dealing with Failure During Freezing
------------------------------------

Regardless whether support for freezing is opt-in or opt-out some
types will not be freezable. (Example such types include IO types
like file handles, and caches -- as opposed to the cached
objects.) This raises the question how to handle failure to freeze
an object graph. Consider the object graph ``o1 --> o2 --> o3``
where ``o1`` and ``o3`` can be frozen, but ``o2`` cannot. What are
the possible behaviours of ``freeze(o1)``?

1. Freeze fails partially. All subgraphs which could be frozen
   entirely remain frozen. Remaining objects remain mutable. In
   our example, ``o3`` remains frozen but ``o1`` and ``o2`` remain
   mutable. This preserves strict immutability. The exception
   thrown by the failing ``freeze(o1)`` call will contain ``o2``
   (the place that caused freezing to fail) and ``o1`` (the object
   in the graph that holds on to the failing object) to facilitate
   debugging.
2. **Rejected alternative**: Freeze fails completely. In the strict
   interpretation of deep immutability, freezing ``o1`` is not
   possible because ``o1`` contains a reference to an un-freezable
   object ``o2``. In this scenario, the object graph ``o1 --> o2
   --> o3`` remains mutable and ``freeze(o1)`` raises an exception
   when the object graph traversal encounters ``o2``.
3. **Rejected alternative**: Freeze succeeds by altering the
   graph. In this example removing ``o2`` from the graph or
   swapping out ``o2`` for a placeholder object to be able to
   freeze the graph. This alternative becomes complicated both to
   reason about from a user's perspective, and to implement when
   ``o2`` is referenced multiple times.
4. **Rejected alternative**: Permit the user to choose between
   alternatives 1) and 3) at use-site. In this case, the
   ``freeze`` function takes an optional 2nd argument ``strict``
   which must either be ``True`` or ``False``. In the first case,
   ``freeze`` behaves as in alternative 1), in the second case,
   it behaves as in alternative 2). We could further track whether
   an object is strictly immutable or not in order to prevent
   non-strictly immutable objects to participate in operations
   which require strictness. This adds additional complexity to
   the implementation, and also for the user.
   
This PEP proposes following alternative 1, where freezing either
succeeds or fails partially.


New Obligations on C Extensions
-------------------------------

Due to the opt-in decision, there are no *obligations* for C
extensions that do not want to add support for immutability. 

Because our implementation builds on information available to the CPython
cycle detector, types defined through C code will support immutability 
"out of the box" as long as they use Python standard types to store
data and uses the built-in functions of these types to modify the data.

To make its instances freezable, a type that uses C extensions
that adds new functionality implemented in C must register
themselves using ``register_freezable(type)``. Example:

.. code-block:: Python

    PyObject *register_freezable = _PyImport_GetModuleAttrString("immutable", "register_freezable");
    if(register_freezable != NULL)
    {
        PyObject* result = PyObject_CallOneArg(register_freezable, (PyObject *)st->Element_Type);
        if(result == NULL){
            goto error;
        }

        Py_DECREF(register_freezable);
    }

If you construct a C type using freezable metaclasses it will itself be freezable,
without need for explicit registration.

To properly support immutability, C extensions that directly write
to data which can be made immutable should add the
``Py_CHECKWRITE`` macro shown above on all paths in the code that
lead to writes to that data. Notably, if C extensions manage their
data through Python objects, no changes are needed.

**Rejected alternative**: Python objects may define a
``__freeze__`` method which will be called **after** an object has
been made immutable. This hook can be used to freeze or otherwise
manage any other state on the side that is introduced through a
C-extension.

C extensions that define data that is outside of the heap traced
by the CPython cycle detector should either manually implement
freezing by using ``Py_CHECKWRITE`` or ensure that all accesses to
this data is *thread-safe*. There are cases where too strict
adherence to immutability is undesirable (as exemplified by our
mutable reference counts), but ideally, it should not be able to
directly observe these effects. (For example, taking the reference
count of an immutable object is not supported to prevent code from
branching on a value that can change non-deterministically by
actions taken in parallel threads.)


Examples of Uses of CHECKWRITE
------------------------------

Inspiration and examples can be found by looking at existing
uses of ``Py_CHECKWRITE`` in the CPython codebase. Two good
starting places are ``object.c`` `[1]`_ and ``dictobject.c`` `[2]`_.

Deep Freezing Semantics
=======================

Following the outcomes of the design decisions discussed just
above, the ``freeze(obj)`` function works as follows:

1. It recursively marks ``obj`` and all objects reachable from ``obj``
   immutable.
2. If ``obj`` is already immutable (e.g., an integer, string, or a
   previously frozen object), the recursion terminates. If ``obj`` cannot
   be frozen, the entire freeze operation is aborted without making any
   object immutable.
3. The freeze operation follows object references (relying on ``tp_traverse`` 
   in the type structs of the objects involved), including:

    * Object attributes (``__dict__`` for user-defined objects,
      ``tp_dict`` for built-in types).
    * Container elements (e.g., lists, tuples, dictionaries,
      sets).
    * The ``__class__`` attribute of an object (which makes freezing
      instances of user-defined classes also freeze their class
      and its attributes).
    * The ``__bases__`` chain in classes (freezing a class freezes its
      base classes).

5. Attempting to mutate a frozen object raises a type error
   with a self-explanatory message.


Illustration of the Deep Freezing Semantics
-------------------------------------------

Consider the following code:

.. code-block:: python

  class Foo:
      pass
  
  x = Foo()
  x.f = 42


The ``Foo`` instance pointed to by ``x`` consists of several
objects: its fields are stored in a dictionary object, and the
assignment ``x.f = 42`` adds two objects to the dictionary in the
form of a string key ``"f"`` and its associated value ``42``.
These objects each have pointers to the ``string`` and ``int``
type objects respectively. Similarly, the ``foo`` instance has a
pointer to the ``Foo`` type object. Finally, all type objects have
pointers to the same meta class object (``type``).

Calling ``freeze(x)`` will freeze **all** of these objects.


Default (Im)Mutabiliy 
---------------------

Except for the type object for ``NotFreezable``, no objects are
immutable by default.

**Rejected alternative**: Interned strings, numbers in the small
integer cache, and tuples of immutable objects could be made
immutable in this PEP. This is either consistent with current
Python semantics or backwards-compatible. We have rejected this
for now as we have not seen a strong need to do so. (A reasonable
such design would make *all* numbers immutable, not just those in
the small integer cache. This should be properly investigated.)


Consequences of Deep Freezing
=============================

* The most obvious consequence of deep freezing is that it can lead
  to surprising results when programmers fail to reason correctly
  about the object structures in memory and how the objects reference
  each other. For example, consider ``freeze(x)`` followed by
  ``y.f = 42``. If the object in ``x`` can reach the same object that
  ``y`` points to, then, the assignment will fail. **Mitigation:** To
  facilitate debugging, exceptions due to attempting to mutate immutable
  objects will include information about on what line an object was made
  immutable.
* Class Freezing: Freezing an instance of a user-defined class
  will also freeze its class. Otherwise, sharing an immutable object
  across threads would lead to sharing its *mutable* type object. Thus,
  freezing an object also freezes the type type object of its super
  classes. This means that any metaprogramming or changes to a class
  must happen before a class is frozen. **Mitigation:** A frozen class
  can be extended and its behaviour overridden through normal object-oriented
  means. If neccessary, it is possible to add an option to make a mutable
  copy of immutable objects and classes, which could then be changed.
  Mutable instances of an immutable class can have their classes changed
  to the mutable copy by reassigning ``__class__``.
* Metaclass Freezing: Since class objects have metaclasses,
  freezing a class may propagate upwards through the metaclass
  hierarchy. This means that the ``type`` object will be made immutable
  at the first call of ``freeze``. **Mitigation:** We have not explored
  mitigation for this, and we are also not aware of major problems
  stemming from this design.
* Global State Impact: Although we have not seen this during our
  later stages of testing, it is possible that freezing an object that references
  global state (e.g., ``sys.modules``, built-ins) could
  inadvertently freeze critical parts of the interpreter.
  **Mitigation:** Avoiding accidental freezing is possible by
  inheriting from (or storing a pointer to) the ``NotFreezable``
  class. Also, when the Python interpreter is exiting, we make all
  immutable objects mutable to facilitate a clean exit of the
  interpreter. Also note that it is not possible to effectively
  disable module imports by freezing.

As the above list shows, a side-effect of freezing an object is
that its type becomes frozen too. Consider the following program,
which is not legal in this PEP because it modifies the type of an
immutable object:

.. code-block:: python

  from immutable import freeze

  class Counter:
      def __init__(self, initial_value):
          self.value = initial_value
      def inc(self):
          self.value += 1
      def dec(self):
          self.value -= 1
      def get(self):
          return self.value

  c = Counter(0)
  c.get() # returns 0 
  freeze(c) # (*) -- this locks the value of the counter to 0
  ... 
  Counter.get = lambda self: 42 # throws exception because Counter is frozen
  c.get() # would have returned 42 unless the line above had been "stopped"

With this PEP, the code above throws an exception on
Line (*) because the type object for the ``Counter`` type
is immutable. Our freeze algorithm takes care of this as
it follows the class reference from ``c``. If we did not
freeze the ``Counter`` type object, the above code would
work and the counter will effectively be mutable because
of the change to its class. 

The dangers of not freezing the type is apparent when considering
avoiding data races in a concurrent program. If a frozen counter
is shared between two threads, the threads are still able to
race on the ``Counter`` class type object.

As types are frozen, this problem is avoided. Note that
freezing a class needs to freeze its superclasses as well.


Subclassing Immutable Classes
-----------------------------

CPython classes hold references to their subclasses. If
immutability it taken literally, it would not be permitted to
create a subclass of an immutable type. Because this reference
does not get exposed to the programmer in any dangerous way, we
permit frozen classes to be subclassed (by mutable classes). C.f.
`Sharing Immutable Data Across Subinterpreters`_.


Freezing Function Objects
-------------------------

Function objects can be thought of as regular objects whose fields
are its local variables -- some of which may be captured from
enclosing scopes. Thus, freezing function objects and lambdas is
surprisingly involved.

Consider the following scenario:

.. code-block:: python

  from immutable import freeze

  def example1():
      x = 0

      def foo():
          return x

      freeze(foo)
      ... # some code, e.g. pass foo to another thread
      x = 1
      foo()

  example1()

In the code above, the ``foo`` function object captures the ``x``
variable from its enclosing scope. While ``x`` happens to point to
an immutable object, the variable itself (the frame of the function object)
is mutable. Unless something is done to prevent it (see below!), passing
``foo`` to another thread will make the assignment ``x = 1`` a potential
data race.

We consider freezing of a function to freeze that function's
meaning at that point in time. In the code above, that means that
``foo`` gets its own copy of ``x`` which will have value of the enclosing
``x`` at the time of freezing, in this case 0.

Thus, the assignment ``x = 1`` is still permitted as it will not affect
``foo``, and it may therefore not contribute to a data race. Furthermore,
the result of calling ``foo()`` will be 0 -- not 1!

This is implemented by having ``x`` in ``foo`` point to a fresh
cell and then freezing the cell (and similar for global capture).
Note that this also prevents ``x`` from being reassigned.

We believe that this design is a sweet-spot that is intuitive and
permissive. Note that we will treat freezing functions that
capture enclosing state in the same way regardless of whether the
enclosing state is another function or the top-level (i.e., the
enclosing scope is ``globals()``).

(A **rejected alternative** is to freeze ``x`` in the
enclosing scope. This is problematic when a captured variable is
in ``globals()`` and also rejects more programs.)

Now consider freezing the following function:

.. code-block:: python

  from immutable import freeze

  def example2():
      x = 0
      def foo(a = False):
          nonlocal x
          if a:
              a = a + 1 # Note: updating local variables work, even in a frozen function
              return a
          else:
              x = x + 1
              return x

      freeze(foo)
      foo(41)  # OK, returns 42
      foo()    # Throws NotWriteableError

  example2()

This example illustrates two things. The first call to ``foo(41)``
shows that local variables on the frame of a frozen function are
mutable. The second call shows that captured variables are not.
Note that the default value of ``a`` will be frozen when ``foo``
is frozen. Thus, the problem of side-effects on default values
on parameters is avoided.

Frozen function objects that access globals, e.g. through an
explicit call to ``globals()``, will throw an exception when
called.


Implementation Details
======================

1. Add the ``immutable`` module, the ``NotWriteableError`` type, and
   the ``NotFreezable`` type.
2. Add the ``freeze(obj)`` function to the ``immutable`` module and
   ensure that it traverses object references safely, including
   cycle detection, and marks objects appropriately, and backs
   out on failure, possibly partially freezing the object graph.
3. Add the ``isfreezable(obj)`` function which checks that all
   objects reachable from ``obj`` can be frozen.
4. Add the ``register_freezable(type)`` function that is used to
   whitelist types implemented as C extensions, permitting their
   instances to be frozen.
6. Add the ``isfrozen(obj)`` function to the ``immutable`` module
   that checks whether or not an object is frozen. The status
   is accessible through ``_Py_ISIMMUTABLE`` in the C API and in
   Python code through the ``isfrozen(obj)`` function.
7. Modify object mutation operations (``PyObject_SetAttr``,
   ``PyDict_SetItem``, ``PyList_SetItem``, etc.) to check the 
   flag and raise an error when appropriate.
8. Modify mutation operations in modules in the standard library.


Changes to the C ABI
--------------------

* ``Py_CHECKWRITE``
* ``_Py_IsImmutable``
* ``PyErr_WriteToImmutable``

Changes to the internal API
---------------------------

* ``_PyType_HasExtensionSlots(PyTypeObject*)`` -- determines whether a TypeObject adds novel functionality in C
* ``_PyNotFreezable_Type``
* ``_PyImmutability_Freeze``
* ``_RegisterFreezable``
* ``_PyImmutability_IsFreezable``


   

Performance Implications
========================

The cost of checking for immutability violations is
an extra dereference of checking the flag on writes.
There are implementation-specific issues, such as
various changes based on how and where the bit is stolen.


More Rejected Alternatives
==========================

1. Shallow Freezing: Only mark the top-level object as immutable.
   This would be less effective for ensuring true immutability
   across references. In particular, this would not make it safe
   to share the results of ``freeze(obj)`` across threads without risking
   data-race errors. Shallow immutability is not strong enough to support 
   sharing immutable objects across subinterpreters (see extensions).
2. Copy-on-Write Immutability: Instead of raising errors on
   mutation, create a modified copy. However, this changes object
   identity semantics and is less predictable. Support for copy-on-write
   may be added later, if a suitable design can be found.
3. Immutable Subclasses: Introduce ``ImmutableDict``, ``ImmutableList``,
   etc., instead of freezing existing objects. However, this does
   not generalize well to arbitrary objects and adds considerable
   complexity to all code bases.
4. Deep freezing immutable copies as proposed in `PEP 351: The 
   freeze protocol <https://peps.python.org/pep-0351/>`_. That PEP
   is the spiritual ancestor to this PEP which tackles the
   problems of the ancestor PEP and more (e.g. meaning of
   immutability when types are mutable, immortality, etc).
5. Deep freezing replaces data races with exceptions on attempts to
   mutate immutable objects. Another alternative would be to keep
   objects mutable and build a data-race detector that catches read--write
   and write--write races. This alternative was rejected for two main
   reasons:

    1. It is expensive to implement: it needs a read-barrier to
       detect what objects are being read by threads to capture
       read--write races.
    2. While more permissive, the model suffers from non-determinism.
       Data races can be hidden in corner cases that require complex
       logic and/or temporal interactions which can be hard to
       test and reproduce.


A Note on Modularisation
========================
   
While the ``freeze(obj)`` function is available to Python programmers
in the ``immutable`` module, the actual freezing code has to live
inside core Python. This is for three reasons:

1. The core object type needs to be able to freeze just-in-time
   dictionaries created by its accessors when the object itself is
   frozen.
2. The managed buffer type needs to be frozen when the object it
   is created from is frozen.
3. Teardown of strongly connected components of immutable objects
   (see `Simplified Garbage Collection for Immutable Object
   Graphs`_) must be hooked into ``Py_DECREF``.

As such, we implement a function which is not in the limited API
(and thus not part of the stable C ABI) called ``_PyImmutability_Freeze``
which performs the freezing logic. This is used internally as a C
Python implementation detail, and then exposed to Python through
the ``freeze(obj)`` function in the ``immutable`` module.


Weak References
===============

Weak references are turned into strong references during freezing.
Thus, an immutable object cannot be effectively mutated by a
weakly referenced nested object being garbage collected. If a weak
reference loses its object during freezing, we treat this as a
failure to freeze since the program is effectively racing with the
garbage collector.

A **rejected alternative** is to nullify the weak reference during
freezing. This avoid the promotion to a strong reference while
ensures that the immutable object stays the same throughout its
lifetime, but probably has the unwanted semantics of pruning the
object graph while freezing it. (Imagine a hash table with weak
references for its keys -- if freezing it removes all its keys,
the hash table is essentially useless.)

Another **rejected alternative** is to simply leave weak references
as is. This was rejected as it makes immutable objects effectively
mutable and access to shared immutable objects can race on accesses
to weak references.


Future Extensions
=================

This PEP is the first in a series of PEPs with the goal of delivering
a Data-Race Free Python that is theoretically compatible with, but 
notably not contigent on, `PEP 703`_.

This work will take place in the following discrete steps:

1. Support for identifying and freeing cyclic immutable garbage
   using reference counting.
2. Support for sharing immutable data across subinterpreters using
   atomic reference counting of immutable objects to permit
   concurrent increments and decrements on shared object RC's.
3. Support for sharing mutable data across subinterpreters, with
   dynamic ownership protecting against data races.
4. Package all of the above into "Data-Race Free Python"

Note that each step above adds something which is directly useful
to Python even before a subsequent step is taken.


Simplified Garbage Collection for Immutable Object Graphs
---------------------------------------------------------

In `previous work <https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3652024.3665507>`_,
we have identified that objects that make up cyclic immutable
garbage will always have the same lifetime. This means that a
single reference count could be used to track the lifetimes of
all the objects in such a strongly connected component (SCC).

We plan to extend the freeze logic with a SCC analysis that
creates a designated (atomic) reference count for the entire
SCC, such that reference count manipulations on any object in
the SCC will be "forwarded" to that shared reference count.
This can be done without bloating objects by repurposing the
existing reference counter data to be used as a pointer to
the shared counter.

This technique permits handling cyclic garbage using plain
reference counting, and because of the single reference count
for an entire SCC, we will detect when all the objects in the
SCC expire at once.

This approach requires a second bit. Our `reference implementation`_
already steals this bit in preparation for this extension.


Support for Atomic Reference Counting
-------------------------------------

As a necessary requirement for the extension `Sharing Immutable Data Across Subinterpreters`_,
we will add support for atomic reference counting for immutable objects. This
will complement work in `Simplified Garbage Collection for Immutable Object Graphs`_,
which aims to make memory management of immutable data more efficient.

When immutable data is shared across threads we must ensure that 
concurrent reference count manipulations are correct, which in turns
requires atomic increments and decrements. Note that since we are only
planning to share immutable objects across different GIL's, it is
*not* possible for two threads to read--write or write--write race
on a single field. Thus we only need to protect the reference counter
manipulations, avoiding most of the complexity of `PEP 703`_


Sharing Immutable Data Across Subinterpreters
---------------------------------------------

We plan to extend the functionality of `multiple subinterpreters <https://peps.python.org/pep-0734/>`_
to *share* immutable data without copying. This is safe and
efficient as it avoids the copying or serialisation when
objects are transmitted across subinterpreters.

This change will require reference counts to be atomic (as
discussed above) and the subclass list of a type object to
be made thread-safe. Additionally, we will need to change
the API for getting a class' subclasses in order to avoid
data races.

This change requires modules loaded in one subinterpreter to be
accessible from another. 


Data-Race Free Python
---------------------

While useful on their own, all the changes above are building
blocks of Data-Race Free Python. Data-Race Free Python will
borrow concepts from ownership (namely region-based ownership,
see e.g. `Cyclone <https://cyclone.thelanguage.org/>`_) to make Python programs data-race free
by construction. Which will permit multiple subinterpreters to
share *mutable* state, although only one subinterpreter at a time
will be able to access (read or write) to that state. 
This work is also compatible with free-theaded Python (PEP 703).

A description of the ownership model can be found in a paper accepted
for PLDI 2025 (an academic conference on design and implementation of
programming languages): `Dynamic Region Ownership for Concurrency
Safety <https://wrigstad.com/pldi2025.pdf>`_.

It is important to point out that Data-Race Free Python is different
from `PEP 703`_, but aims to be fully compatible with that PEP, and
we believe that both PEPs can benefit from each other. In essence
`PEP 703`_'s focus is on making the CPython run-time resilient against
data races in Python programs: a poorly synchronized Python program
should not be able to corrupt reference counts, or other parts of
the Python interpreter. The complementary goal pursued by this PEP
is to make it impossible for Python programs to have data races.
Support for deeply immutable data is the first important step
towards this goal.


Reference Implementation
========================

`Available here <https://github.com/mjp41/cpython/pull/51>`_.

There are some discrepancies between this PEP and the reference
implementation, including:

- The ``isfreezable(obj)`` function is not yet implemented.
- The ``NotFreezable`` type is currently freezable (but inheriting
  from it stops instances of the inheriting class from being frozen). 


Rebasing on Python 3.14
=======================

We have found two areas that need to be addressed to integrate this work with "free-threaded Python": data-representation and data-races during freeze.

Data-representation for immutability
------------------------------------

With free-threaded Python the representation of the reference count has been changed.  We could either borrow a bit to represent if an object is frozen, or alternatively, we could use the new `ob_tid` field to have a special value for immutable state.  Using `ob_tid` would allow for standard mutable thread local objects to remain the fast path, and is our preferred alternative.

The extensions use use SCC calculations to detect cycles in immutable graphs, would require additional state.  Repurposing `ob_tid` and `ob_ref_shared` would allow sufficient space for the necessary calculation.

Data-races during freeze
------------------------

We consider the following races

- Freezing some objects concurrently with another thread checking if a graph is immutable.
- Freezing some objects concurrently with another thread mutating those objects.
- Freezing some objects concurrently with another thread freezing those objects.

To address the first race, we need to consider strictness of deep immutability.  We need to ensure that querying an object graph for immutability only says yes if it is deeply immutable. This requires a two step immutable state: immutable but not strict, and then immutable and strict. On a DFS traversal of the object graph items are marked as immutable but not strict on the pre-order step, and then immutable and strict on the post-order step.  To query if a graph is immutable, we will require the "immutable and strict" state.

Handling mutation during freeze can use the mutex added by free-threading. There are some cases where mutation does not require the acquisition of a mutex, which would no longer allowed with this feature.  Freezing would be required to lock the object, marks it as immutable, release the lock, and then read all its fields.

The final case is the most complex detecting parallel freezing of an object graph.  We will consider this an error.  This error can be detected as follows.  If we encounter an object that is "immutable but not strict", then this should be on the path to the current object from the starting point of the freeze.  If this is not the case, then we must be observing another thread freezing an object graph.  The algorithm should back out the pending aspects of freeze, and raise an exception to the user.  This can naturally be integrated with the SCC algorithm.

.. [#RC] Note that the same logic does not apply to e.g. an
         object's reference count. The reference count is
         metadata about an object that is stored in the object
         for purely pragmatic reasons, but this data really
         belongs to the memory management logic of the
         interpreter, not the object itself.
