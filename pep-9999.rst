PEP: 9999
Title: Dependency specification in pyproject.toml using an exploded TOML table
Author: Laurie Opperman <laurie_opperman@hotmail.com>
Status: Draft
Type: Standards Track
Content-Type: text/x-rst
Created: 02-09-2020
Post-History: TBD


Abstract
========

This PEP specifies how to write a project's dependencies in a
``pyproject.toml`` file for packaging-related tools to consume using the fields
defined in :pep:`621`, as an alternative to the :pep:`508`-based approach
defined in :pep:`631`. Specifically, the tables ``project.dependencies`` and
``project.optional-dependencies`` are defined.


Motivation
==========

There are multiple benefits to using TOML tables and other data-types to
represent requirements rather then :pep:`508` strings:

- Easy initial validation via the TOML syntax.

- Easy secondary validation using a schema, for example a `JSON Schema`_.

- Potential for users to guess the keys of given features, rather than
  memorising a syntax.

- Users of multiple other popular languages may already be familiar with the
  TOML syntax.

- TOML directly represents the same data structures as in JSON, and therefore a
  sub-set of Python literals, so users can understand the hierarchy and type of
  value

.. _JSON Schema: https://json-schema.org/


Rationale
=========

Most of this is taken from discussions in the `PEP 621 dependencies topic`_.
This has elements from `Pipfile`_, `Poetry`_, `Dart's dependencies`_ and
`Rust's Cargo`_. A `comparison document`_ shows advantages and disadvantages
between this format and :pep:`508`-style specifiers.

One example is the need to allow for specifying distributions in multiple
dependencies (environment markers will choose the appropriate dependency).

Some dependency specifications, as in `Poetry`_, separate the :pep:`508`
environment markers into separate keys in the requirement. This loses the
general Python-like syntax for environment markers, and also removes the
ability to logically combines the markers with grouped `and` and `or`
operations.

The direct-reference keys closely align with and utilise pep:`610` and
:pep:`440` as to reduce differences in the packaging ecosystem and rely on
previous work in specification.

Specification
=============

As in :pep:`621`, if metadata is improperly specified then tools MUST raise an
error. The metadata MUST conform to the `toml`_ specification.

To reduce confusion with this document being a specification for specifying
dependencies, the word "requirement" is used to mean a :pep:`508` dependency
specification.

The following tables are added to the added to the ``project`` table specified
in :pep:`621`.

.. _toml: https://toml.io/

dependencies
------------

Format: table

The keys inside this table are the names of the required distribution. The
values can have one of the following types:

- string: the requirement is defined only by a version requirement, with same
  specification as ``version`` in the requirement table, except allowing the
  empty string ``""`` to place no restriction on the version.

- table: a requirement table.

- array: an array of requirement tables. It is an error to specify an empty
  array ``[]`` as a value.

.. _requirement-spec:

Requirement table
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The keys of the requirement table are as follows:

- ``version`` (string): a :pep:`440` version specifier, which is a comma-
  delimited list of version specifier clauses. The string MUST be non-empty.

- ``extras`` (array of strings): a list of :pep:`508` extras declarations for
  the distribution. The list MUST be non-empty.

- ``markers`` (string): a :pep:`508` environment marker expression. The string
  MUST be non-empty.

- ``url`` (string): the URL of the artifact to install and satisfy the
  requirement. Note that ``file://`` is the prefix used for packages to be
  retrieved from the local filesystem.

- ``git``, ``hg``, ``bzr`` or ``svn`` (string): the URL of a VCS repository to
  to clone, whose tree will be installed to satisfy the requirement. Further
  VCS keys will be added via amendments to :pep:`610`, however tools can opt to
  support other VCS's using their command-line command prior to the acceptance
  of the amendment.

- ``revision`` (string): the identifier for a specific revision of the
  specified VCS repository to check-out before installtion. Users MUST only
  provide this when one of ``git``, ``hg``, ``bzr``, ``svn``, or another VCS
  key is used to identify the distribution to install. Revision identifiers are
  suggested in :pep:`610`.

At most one of the following keys can be specified simultaneously, as they
logically conflict with each other in the requirement: ``version``, ``url``,
``git``, ``hg``, ``bzr``, ``svn``, and any other VCS key.

An empty requirement table ``{}`` places no restriction on the requirement.

optional-dependencies
---------------------

Format: table

The keys inside this table are the names of an extra's required distribution.
The values can have one of the following types:

- table: a requirement table.

- array: an array of requirement tables.

These requirement tables have
`the same specification as above <#requirement-spec>`_, with the addition of
the following required key:

- ``for-extra`` (string): the name of the :pep:`508` extra that this
  requirement is required for.


Reference implementation
========================

Tools will need to convert this format to :pep:`508` requirement strings. Below
is an example implementation of that conversion (assuming validation is already
performed):

.. code-block:: python

    def convert_requirement_to_pep508(name, requirement):
        if isinstance(requirement, str):
            requirement = {"version": requirement}
        pep508 = name
        if "extras" in requirement:
            pep508 += " [" + ", ".join(requirement["extras"]) + "]"
        if "version" in requirement:
            pep508 += " " + requirement["version"]
        if "url" in requirement:
            pep508 += " @ " + requirement["url"]
        for vcs in ("git", "hg", "bzr", "svn"):
            if vcs in requirement:
                pep508 += " @ " + vcs + "+" requirement[vcs]
                if "revision" in requirement:
                    pep508 += "@" + revision
        extra = None
        if "for-extra" in requirement:
            extra = requirement["for-extra"]
        if "markers" in requirement:
            markers = requirement["markers"]
            if extra:
                markers = "extra = '" + extra + "' and (" + markers + ")"
            pep508 += "; " + markers
        return pep508, extra


    def convert_requirements_to_pep508(dependencies):
        pep508s = []
        extras = []
        for name, req in dependencies.items():
            if isinstance(req, list):
                for sub_req in req:
                    pep508, extra = convert_requirement_to_pep508(name, sub_req)
                    pep508s.append(pep508)
                    if extra:
                        extras.append(extra)
            else:
                pep508, extra = convert_requirement_to_pep508(name, sub_req)
                pep508s.append(pep508)
                if extra:
                    extras.append(extra)
        return pep508s, extras


    def convert_project_requirements_to_pep508(project):
        reqs, _ = convert_requirements_to_pep508(project.get("dependencies", {}))
        optional_reqs, extras = convert_requirements_to_pep508(
            project.get("optional-dependencies", {})
        )
        reqs += optional_reqs
        return reqs, extras


Examples
========

Full example:

.. code-block:: toml

    [project.dependencies]
    flask = { }
    django = { }
    requests = { version = ">= 2.8.1, == 2.8.*", extras = ["security", "tests"], markers = "python_version < '2.7'" }
    pip = { url = "https://github.com/pypa/pip/archive/1.3.1.zip" }
    sphinx = { git = "ssh://git@github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx.git" }
    numpy = "~=1.18"
    pytest = [
        { version = "<6", markers = "python_version < '3.5'" },
        { version = ">=6", markers = "python_version >= '3.5'" },
    ]

In homage to :pep:`631`, the following is an equivalent dependencies
specification for `docker-compose`_:

    [project.dependencies]
    cached-property = ">= 1.2.0, < 2"
    distro = ">= 1.2.0, < 2"
    docker = { extras = ["ssh"], version = ">= 4.2.2, < 5" }

    pytest = { version = "< 6", for-extra = "tests" }
    mock = { version = ">= 1.0.1, < 4", markers = "python_version < '3.4'", for-extra = "tests" }

Compatibility Examples
======================

The authors of this PEP recognises that various tools need to both read
from and write to this format for dependency specification. This section
aims to provide direct comparison with and examples for translating to/from
the currently used standard, :pep:`508`.

.. note::

        For simplicity and clarity, various ways in which TOML allows you to specify each
        specification is not represented. These examples use the standard inline representation.

        For example, while following are considered equivalent in TOML, we choose the
        second form for the examples in this section.

        .. code-block:: toml

            aiohttp.version = "== 3.6.2"
            aiohttp = { version = "== 3.6.2" }


Version Constrained Dependencies
--------------------------------

**No Version Constraint**

.. code-block::

        aiohttp


.. code-block:: toml

        aiohttp = {}

**Simple Version Constraint**

.. code-block::

        aiohttp (>= 3.6.2, < 4.0.0)


.. code-block:: toml

        aiohttp = { version = ">= 3.6.2, < 4.0.0" }


.. note::

        This can, for conciseness, be also represented as a string.

        .. code-block:: toml

            aiohttp = ">= 3.6.2, < 4.0.0"



Direct Reference Dependencies
-----------------------------

**URL Dependency**

.. code-block::

        aiohttp @ https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/97/d1/1cc7a1f84097d7abdc6c09ee8d2260366f081f8e82da36ebb22a25cdda9f/aiohttp-3.6.2-cp35-cp35m-macosx_10_13_x86_64.whl


.. code-block:: toml

        aiohttp = { url = "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/97/d1/1cc7a1f84097d7abdc6c09ee8d2260366f081f8e82da36ebb22a25cdda9f/aiohttp-3.6.2-cp35-cp35m-macosx_10_13_x86_64.whl" }

**VCS Dependency**

.. code-block::

        aiohttp @ git+ssh://git@github.com:aio-libs/aiohttp.git@master


.. code-block:: toml

        aiohttp = { git = "git@github.com:aio-libs/aiohttp.git", revision = "master" }


Environment Markers
-------------------

.. code-block::

        aiohttp (>= 3.6.1) ; python_version >= '3.8'


.. code-block:: toml

        aiohttp = { version = ">= 3.6.1", markers = "python_version >= '3.8'" }


A slightly extended example of the above, where a particular version of ``aiohttp`` is required based on the interpreter version.

.. code-block::

        aiohttp (>= 3.6.1) ; python_version >= '3.8'
        aiohttp (>= 3.0.0, < 3.6.1) ; python_version < '3.8'


.. code-block:: toml

        aiohttp = [
            { version = ">= 3.6.1", markers = "python_version >= '3.8'" },
            { version = ">= 3.0.0, < 3.6.1", markers = "python_version < '3.8'" }
        ]


Package Extras
--------------

**Specifying dependency for a package extra**

.. code-block::

        aiohttp (>= 3.6.2) ; extra == 'http'


.. code-block:: toml

        aiohttp = { version = ">= 3.6.2", for-extra = "http" }

**Using extras from a dependency**

.. code-block::

        aiohttp [speedups] (>= 3.6.2)


.. code-block:: toml

        aiohttp = { version = ">= 3.6.2", extras = ["speedups"] }


Complex Examples
----------------

**Version Constraint**

.. code-block::

        aiohttp [speedups] (>=3.6.2) ; python_version >= '3.8' and extra == 'http'


.. code-block:: toml

        aiohttp = { version = ">= 3.6.2", extras = ["speedups"], markers = "python_version >= '3.8'", for-extra = "http" }


**Direct Reference (VCS)**

.. code-block::

        aiohttp [speedups] @ git+ssh://git@github.com:aio-libs/aiohttp.git@master ; python_version >= '3.8' and extra == 'http'


.. code-block:: toml

        aiohttp = { git = "git@github.com:aio-libs/aiohttp.git", revision = "master", extras = ["speedups"], markers = "python_version >= '3.8'", for-extra = "http" }


Rejected Ideas
==============

- Using an array for `dependencies` instead of a table, in order to have each
  element only be a table (with a `name` key) and no arrays of requirement
  tables. This was very verbose and restrictive in the TOML format, and having
  multiple requirements for a given distribution isn't very common.

- Removing the ``optional-dependencies`` table in favour of both including an
  ``optional`` key in the requirement and an ``extras`` table which specifies
  which (optional) requirements are needed for a project's extra. This reduces
  the number of table with the same specification (to 1) and allows for
  requirements to be specified once but used in multiple extras, but distances
  some of the requirement's properties (which extra(s) it belongs to), groups
  required and optional dependencies together (possibly mixed), and there may
  not be a simple way to choose a requirement when a distribution has multiple
  requirements. This was rejected as ``optional-dependencies`` has already been
  accepted in :pep:`621`.

- Include the direct-reference keys in a ``direct`` table, have the VCS
  specified as the value of a ``vcs`` key. This was more explicit and easier to
  include in a JSON-schema validation, but was decided to be too verbose and
  not as readable.

- Include hash in direct-reference requirements. This was only for package
  lock-files, and didn't really have a place in the project's metadata.

- Have the ``optional-dependencies`` be a table of dependency tables for each
  extra, with the table name being the extra's name. This made
  ``optional-dependencies`` a different type (table of tables of requirements)
  from ``dependencies`` (table of requirements), which could be jarring for
  users and harder to parse.

- Making each :pep:`508` environment marker as a key (or child-table key) in
  the requirement. This arguably increases readability and ease of parsing.
  The ``markers`` key would still be allowed for more advanced specification,
  with which the key-specified environment markers are ``and``'d with the
  result of. This was deferred as more design needs to be undertaken.

- Replacing the `for-extra` key with `for-extras`, with the value being an
  array of extras to makr the requirement a dependency for. This reduces some
  duplication, but in this case that duplication makes explicit which extras
  have which dependencies.
