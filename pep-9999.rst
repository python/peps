Abstract
========

Extend the classes for built-in functions and methods to be more like Python functions. Specifically, built-in functions and methods will gain access to the module they are declared in, and built-in methods will have access to the class they belong to. This will allow tools like Cython to use the standard built-in function and method classes, thus gaining performance parity with built-in functions like ``len`` or ``print``.
Performance of existing code is not expected to change significantly.

One new function will be added to the C API to allow third-party code to create built-in functions in an efficient and portable manner.

Motivation
==========

Currently third-party module authors face a dilemna when implementing
functions in C. Either they can use one of the pre-existing built-in function 
or method classes or implement their own custom class in C.
The first choice causes them to lose the ability to access module-level data; 
the second choice is an additional maintenance burden and, more importantly,
has a significant negative impact on performance.

This PEP aims to allow authors of third-party C modules, and tools like to Cython, to
utilise the pre-existing built-in function or method classes without a loss of capabilities relative to a function implemented in Python.

Enhanced access to the function's enviroment
--------------------------------------------

Built-in functions will gain efficient access to the module in which they are declared,
and if declared in a class, efficient access to that class as well.

Performance
-----------

No significant change is expected.

Introspection
-------------

No changes to built-in functions are required to support introspection.

The ``inspect.Signature.from_callable()`` function computes the signature of a callable. If an object has a ``__signature__`` 
property, then ``inspect.Signature.from_callable()`` simply returns that. If a builtin-callable has a ``__text_signature__``
then the ``__signature__`` is created from that.
This means that 3rd party builtin-functions can implement ``__text_signature__`` if sufficient,
and the more expensive ``__signature__`` if necessary.

New classes and changes to existing classes
===========================================

Python visible changes
----------------------

#. A new built-in class, ``builtin_function``, will be added.

#. ``types.BuiltinFunctionType`` will refer to ``builtin_function`` not ``builtin_function_or_method``.

#. Instances of the ``builtin_function`` class will retain the ``__module__`` property of ``builtin_function_or_method`` and gain the ``func_module`` and ``func_globals`` properties. The ``func_module`` allows access to the module to which the function belongs. Note that this is different from the ``__module__`` property which merely returns the name of the module. The ``func_globals`` property is equivalent to ``func_module.__dict__`` and is provided to mimic the Python function property of the same name.

#. The ``method_descriptor`` class will become a sub-class of the new ``builtin_function`` class.

#. When binding a ``method_descriptor`` instance to an instance of its owning class, a ``bound_method`` will be created instead of a ``builtin_function_or_method``. This means that the ``method_descriptors`` now mimic the behaviour of Python functions more closely. In other words, ``[].append`` becomes a ``bound_method`` instead of a ``builtin_function_or_method``.


Note that ``method_descriptor`` instances will only have access to their module if their ``__objclass__`` class has access to its module. If PEP 573 is approved, then that will be possible.

C API changes
-------------

#. A new function ``PyBuiltinFunction_New(PyMethodDef *ml, PyObject *module)`` is added to create built-in functions.

#. ``PyCFunction_NewEx()`` and ``PyCFunction_New()`` are deprecated and will return a ``PyBuiltinFunction`` if able, otherwise a ``builtin_function_or_method``.

Retaining backwards compatibility in the C API and ABI
------------------------------------------------------

The ``PyCFunction_Type`` object will continue to exist for backwards compatibility in the ABI, but no
instances of it would be created in the interpreter or the standard library.

Internal C changes
------------------

The new C struct for built-in functions is::

    typedef struct {
        PyObject_HEAD
        PyMethodDef m_ml; /* Description of the C function to call */
        PyObject    *m_module; /* The func_module attribute, must be an actual module */
        PyObject    *m_weakreflist; /* List of weak references */
    } PyBuiltinFunctionObject;

and the C struct for ``method_descriptor``\s changes to::

    typedef struct {
        PyBuiltinFunctionObject base;
        PyTypeObject *m_objclass; /* The __objclass__ attibute */
    } PyMethodDescrObject;


Possible Extensions
===================

Callables for operators, like ``int.__add__``, could become instances of the ``method_descriptor`` class, instead of the ``slot_wrapper`` class.
This would further reduce the number of classes representing built-in callables, but is not necessary to fulfil the above requirements.

If the ``slot__wrapper`` class were removed, then two new ``METH_`` flags would need to be added.
The new flags would be ``METH_OO`` and ``METH_TRIO`` for two and three argument operators respectively.



Alternative Suggestions
=======================

`PEP 575 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0575/>` is an alternative approach to solving the same problem as this PEP.
