Introduction
============

This PEP describes the ``import as`` proposal for Python 2.0.  This
PEP tracks the status and ownership of this feature.  It contains
a description of the feature and outlines changes necessary to
support the feature.  The CVS revision history of this file
contains the definitive historical record.


Rationale
=========

This PEP proposes an extension of Python syntax regarding the
``import`` and ``from <module> import`` statements.  These statements
load in a module, and either bind that module to a local name, or
binds objects from that module to a local name.  However, it is
sometimes desirable to bind those objects to a different name, for
instance to avoid name clashes.  This can currently be achieved
using the following idiom::

    import os
    real_os = os
    del os

And similarly for the ``from ... import`` statement::

    from os import fdopen, exit, stat
    os_fdopen = fdopen
    os_stat = stat
    del fdopen, stat

The proposed syntax change would add an optional ``as`` clause to
both these statements, as follows::

    import os as real_os
    from os import fdopen as os_fdopen, exit, stat as os_stat

The ``as`` name is not intended to be a keyword, and some trickery
has to be used to convince the CPython parser it isn't one.  For
more advanced parsers/tokenizers, however, this should not be a
problem.

A slightly special case exists for importing sub-modules.  The
statement ::

    import os.path

stores the module ``os`` locally as ``os``, so that the imported
submodule ``path`` is accessible as ``os.path``.  As a result, ::

    import os.path as p

stores ``os.path``, not ``os``, in ``p``.  This makes it effectively the
same as ::

    from os import path as p


Implementation details
======================

This PEP has been accepted, and the suggested code change has been
checked in.  The patch can still be found in the SourceForge patch
manager [1]_.  Currently, a ``NAME`` field is used in the grammar rather
than a bare string, to avoid the keyword issue.  It introduces a
new bytecode, ``IMPORT_STAR``, which performs the ``from module import
*`` behaviour, and changes the behaviour of the ``IMPORT_FROM``
bytecode so that it loads the requested name (which is always a
single name) onto the stack, to be subsequently stored by a ``STORE``
opcode. As a result, all names explicitly imported now follow the
``global`` directives.

The special case of ``from module import *`` remains a special case,
in that it cannot accommodate an ``as`` clause, and that no ``STORE``
opcodes are generated; the objects imported are loaded directly
into the local namespace. This also means that names imported in
this fashion are always local, and do not follow the ``global``
directive.

An additional change to this syntax has also been suggested, to
generalize the expression given after the ``as`` clause.  Rather
than a single name, it could be allowed to be any expression that
yields a valid l-value; anything that can be assigned to.  The
change to accommodate this is minimal, as the patch [2]_ proves, and
the resulting generalization allows a number of new constructs
that run completely parallel with other Python assignment
constructs. However, this idea has been rejected by Guido, as
"hypergeneralization".
