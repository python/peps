Abstract
========

Add functions to the Python C API to specialize pure Python functions:
add specialized codes with guards. It allows to implement static
optimizers respecting the Python semantics.


Rationale
=========

Python semantics
----------------

Python is hard to optimize because almost everything is mutable: builtin
functions, function code, global variables, local variables, ... can be
modified at runtime. Implement optimizations respecting the Python
semantics requires to detect when "something changes", we will call these
checks "guards".

This PEP proposes to add a public API to the Python C API to add
specialized codes with guards to a function. When the function is
called, a specialized code is used if nothing changed, otherwise use the
original bytecode.

Even if guards help to respect most parts of the Python semantics, it's
hard to optimize Python without making subtle changes on the exact
behaviour. CPython has a long history and many applications rely on
implementation details. A compromise must be found between "everything
is mutable" and performance.

Writing an optimizer is out of the scope of this PEP.


Why not a JIT compiler?
-----------------------

There are multiple JIT compilers for Python actively developed:

* `PyPy <http://pypy.org/>`_
* `Pyston <https://github.com/dropbox/pyston>`_
* `Numba <http://numba.pydata.org/>`_
* `Pyjion <https://github.com/microsoft/pyjion>`_

Numba is specific to numerical computation.  Pyston and Pyjion are still
young.  PyPy is the most complete Python interpreter, it is generally
faster than CPython in micro- and many macro-benchmarks and has a very
good compatibility with CPython (it respects the Python semantics).
There are still issues with Python JIT compilers which avoid them to be
widely used instead of CPython.

Many popular libraries like numpy, PyGTK, PyQt, PySide and wxPython are
implemented in C or C++ and use the Python C API. To have a small memory
footprint and better performances, Python JIT compilers do not use
reference counting to use a faster garbage collector, do not use C
structures of CPython objects and manage memory allocations differently.
PyPy has a ``cpyext`` module which emulates the Python C API but it has
worse performances than CPython and does not support the full Python C
API.

New features are first developped in CPython. In january 2016, the
latest CPython stable version is 3.5, whereas PyPy only supports Python
2.7 and 3.2, and Pyston only supports Python 2.7.

Even if PyPy has a very good compatibility with Python, some modules are
still not compatible with PyPy: see `PyPy Compatibility Wiki
<https://bitbucket.org/pypy/compatibility/wiki/Home>`_. The incomplete
support of the the Python C API is part of this problem. There are also
subtle differences between PyPy and CPython like reference counting:
object destructors are always called in PyPy, but can be called "later"
than in CPython. Using context managers helps to control when resources
are released.

Even if PyPy is much faster than CPython in a wide range of benchmarks,
some users still report worse performances than CPython on some specific
use cases or unstable performances.

When Python is used as a scripting program for programs running less
than 1 minute, JIT compilers can be slower because their startup time is
higher and the JIT compiler takes time to optimize the code. For
example, most Mercurial commands take a few seconds.

Numba now supports ahead of time compilation, but it requires decorator
to specify arguments types and it only supports numerical types.

CPython 3.5 has almost no optimization: the peephole optimizer only
implements basic optimizations. A static compiler is a compromise
between CPython 3.5 and PyPy.

.. note::
   There was also the Unladen Swallow project, but it was abandoned in
   2011.


Examples
========

Following examples are not written to show powerful optimizations
promising important speedup, but to be short and easy to understand,
just to explain the principle.

Hypothetical myoptimizer module
-------------------------------

Examples in this PEP uses an hypothetical ``myoptimizer`` module which
provides the following functions and types:

* ``specialize(func, code, guards)``: add the specialized code `code`
  with guards `guards` to the function `func`
* ``get_specialized(func)``: get the list of specialized codes as a list
  of ``(code, guards)`` tuples where `code` is a callable or code object
  and `guards` is a list of a guards
* ``GuardBuiltins(name)``: guard watching for
  ``builtins.__dict__[name]`` and ``globals()[name]``. The guard fails
  if ``builtins.__dict__[name]`` is replaced, or if ``globals()[name]``
  is set.


Using bytecode
--------------

Add specialized bytecode where the call to the pure builtin function
``chr(65)`` is replaced with its result ``"A"``::

    import myoptimizer

    def func():
        return chr(65)

    def fast_func():
        return "A"

    myoptimizer.specialize(func, fast_func.__code__,
                           [myoptimizer.GuardBuiltins("chr")])
    del fast_func

Example showing the behaviour of the guard::

    print("func(): %s" % func())
    print("#specialized: %s" % len(myoptimizer.get_specialized(func)))
    print()

    import builtins
    builtins.chr = lambda obj: "mock"

    print("func(): %s" % func())
    print("#specialized: %s" % len(myoptimizer.get_specialized(func)))

Output::

    func(): A
    #specialized: 1

    func(): mock
    #specialized: 0

The first call uses the specialized bytecode which returns the string
``"A"``. The second call removes the specialized code because the
builtin ``chr()`` function was replaced, and executes the original
bytecode calling ``chr(65)``.

On a microbenchmark, calling the specialized bytecode takes 88 ns,
whereas the original function takes 145 ns (+57 ns): 1.6 times as fast.


Using builtin function
----------------------

Add the C builtin ``chr()`` function as the specialized code instead of
a bytecode calling ``chr(obj)``::

    import myoptimizer

    def func(arg):
        return chr(arg)

    myoptimizer.specialize(func, chr,
                           [myoptimizer.GuardBuiltins("chr")])

Example showing the behaviour of the guard::

    print("func(65): %s" % func(65))
    print("#specialized: %s" % len(myoptimizer.get_specialized(func)))
    print()

    import builtins
    builtins.chr = lambda obj: "mock"

    print("func(65): %s" % func(65))
    print("#specialized: %s" % len(myoptimizer.get_specialized(func)))

Output::

    func(): A
    #specialized: 1

    func(): mock
    #specialized: 0

The first call calls the C builtin ``chr()`` function (without creating
a Python frame). The second call removes the specialized code because
the builtin ``chr()`` function was replaced, and executes the original
bytecode.

On a microbenchmark, calling the C builtin takes 95 ns, whereas the
original bytecode takes 155 ns (+60 ns): 1.6 times as fast. Calling
directly ``chr(65)`` takes 76 ns.


Choose the specialized code
===========================

Pseudo-code to choose the specialized code to call a pure Python
function::

    def call_func(func, args, kwargs):
        specialized = myoptimizer.get_specialized(func)
        nspecialized = len(specialized)
        index = 0
        while index < nspecialized:
            specialized_code, guards = specialized[index]

            for guard in guards:
                check = guard(args, kwargs)
                if check:
                    break

            if not check:
                # all guards succeeded:
                # use the specialized code
                return specialized_code
            elif check == 1:
                # a guard failed temporarely:
                # try the next specialized code
                index += 1
            else:
                assert check == 2
                # a guard will always fail:
                # remove the specialized code
                del specialized[index]

        # if a guard of each specialized code failed, or if the function
        # has no specialized code, use original bytecode
        code = func.__code__



Changes
=======

Changes to the Python C API:

* Add a ``PyFuncGuardObject`` object and a ``PyFuncGuard_Type`` type
* Add a ``PySpecializedCode`` structure
* Add the following fields to the ``PyFunctionObject`` structure::

    Py_ssize_t nb_specialized;
    PySpecializedCode *specialized;

* Add function methods:

  * ``PyFunction_Specialize()``
  * ``PyFunction_GetSpecializedCodes()``
  * ``PyFunction_GetSpecializedCode()``

None of these function and types are exposed at the Python level.

All these additions are explicitly excluded of the stable ABI.

When a function code is replaced (``func.__code__ = new_code``), all
specialized codes and guards are removed.


Function guard
--------------

Add a function guard object::

    typedef struct {
        PyObject ob_base;
        int (*init) (PyObject *guard, PyObject *func);
        int (*check) (PyObject *guard, PyObject **stack, int na, int nk);
    } PyFuncGuardObject;

The ``init()`` function initializes a guard:

* Return ``0`` on success
* Return ``1`` if the guard will always fail: ``PyFunction_Specialize()``
  must ignore the specialized code
* Raise an exception and return ``-1`` on error


The ``check()`` function checks a guard:

* Return ``0`` on success
* Return ``1`` if the guard failed temporarely
* Return ``2`` if the guard will always fail: the specialized code must
  be removed
* Raise an exception and return ``-1`` on error

*stack* is an array of arguments: indexed arguments followed by (*key*,
*value*) pairs of keyword arguments. *na* is the number of indexed
arguments. *nk* is the number of keyword arguments: the number of (*key*,
*value*) pairs. `stack` contains ``na + nk * 2`` objects.


Specialized code
----------------

Add a specialized code structure::

    typedef struct {
        PyObject *code;        /* callable or code object */
        Py_ssize_t nb_guard;
        PyObject **guards;     /* PyFuncGuardObject objects */
    } PySpecializedCode;


Function methods
----------------

Add a function method to specialize the function, add a specialized code
with guards::

    int PyFunction_Specialize(PyObject *func,
                              PyObject *code, PyObject *guards)

If *code* is a Python function, the code object of the *code* function
is used as the specialized code. The specialized Python function must
have the same parameter defaults, the same keyword parameter defaults,
and must not have specialized code.

If *code* is a Python function or a code object, a new code object is
created and the code name and first number number of the code object of
*func* are copied. The specialized code must have the same cell
variables and the same free variables.

Result:

* Return ``0`` on success
* Return ``1`` if the specialization has been ignored
* Raise an exception and return ``-1`` on error

Add a function method to get the list of specialized codes::

    PyObject* PyFunction_GetSpecializedCodes(PyObject *func)

Return a list of (*code*, *guards*) tuples where *code* is a callable or
code object and *guards* is a list of ``PyFuncGuard`` objects. Raise an
exception and return ``NULL`` on error.

Add a function method to get the specialized code::

    PyObject* PyFunction_GetSpecializedCode(PyObject *func,
                                            PyObject **stack,
                                            int na, int nk)

See ``check()`` function of guards for *stack*, *na* and *nk* arguments.
Return a callable or a code object on success. Raise an exception and
return ``NULL`` on error.

Benchmark
---------

Microbenchmark on ``python3.6 -m timeit -s 'def f(): pass' 'f()'`` (best
of 3 runs):

* Original Python: 79 ns
* Patched Python: 79 ns

According to this microbenchmark, the changes has no overhead on calling
a Python function without specialization.


Implementation
==============

The `issue #26098: PEP 510: Specialize functions with guards
<http://bugs.python.org/issue26098>`_ contains a patch which implements
this PEP.


Other implementations of Python
===============================

This PEP only contains changes to the Python C API, the Python API is
unchanged. Other implementations of Python are free to not implement new
additions, or implement added functions as no-op:

* ``PyFunction_Specialize()``: always return ``1`` (the specialization
  has been ignored)
* ``PyFunction_GetSpecializedCodes()``: always return an empty list
* ``PyFunction_GetSpecializedCode()``: return the function code object,
  as the existing ``PyFunction_GET_CODE()`` macro
