Abstract
========

This PEP proposes supporting user-defined ``__setattr__``
and ``__delattr__`` methods on modules to extend customization
of module attribute access beyond :pep:`562`.

Motivation
==========

There are several potential uses of a module ``__setattr__``:

1. To prevent setting an attribute at all (i.e. make it read-only)
2. To validate the value to be assigned
3. To intercept setting an attribute and update some other state

Proper support for read-only attributes would also require adding the
``__delattr__`` function to prevent their deletion.

A typical workaround is assigning the ``__class__`` of a module object to a
custom subclass of :py:class:`python:types.ModuleType` (see [1]_).
Unfortunately, this also brings a noticeable speed regression
(~2-3x) for attribute *access*.  It would be convenient to directly
support such customization, by recognizing ``__setattr__`` and ``__delattr__``
methods defined in a module that would act like normal
:py:meth:`python:object.__setattr__` and :py:meth:`python:object.__delattr__`
methods, except that they will be defined on module *instances*.

For example

.. code:: python

   # mlib.py

   CONSTANT = 3.14
   prec = 53
   dps = 15

   def dps_to_prec(n):
       """Return the number of bits required to represent n decimals accurately."""
       return max(1, int(round((int(n)+1)*3.3219280948873626)))

   def prec_to_dps(n):
       """Return the number of accurate decimals that can be represented with n bits."""
       return max(1, int(round(int(n)/3.3219280948873626)-1))

   def validate(n):
       n = int(n)
       if n <= 0:
           raise ValueError('non-negative integer expected')
       return n

   def __setattr__(name, value):
       if name == 'CONSTANT':
           raise AttributeError('Read-only attribute!')
       if name == 'dps':
           value = validate(value)
           globals()['dps'] = value
           globals()['prec'] = dps_to_prec(value)
           return
       if name == 'prec':
           value = validate(value)
           globals()['prec'] = value
           globals()['dps'] = prec_to_dps(value)
           return
       globals()[name] = value

   def __delattr__(name):
       if name in ('CONSTANT', 'dps', 'prec'):
           raise AttributeError('Read-only attribute!')
       del globals()[name]

.. code:: pycon

  >>> import mplib
  >>> mplib.foo = 'spam'
  >>> mplib.CONSTANT = 42
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
  AttributeError: Read-only attribute!
  >>> del mplib.foo
  >>> del mplib.CONSTANT
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
  AttributeError: Read-only attribute!
  >>> mplib.prec
  53
  >>> mplib.dps
  15
  >>> mplib.dps = 5
  >>> mplib.prec
  20
  >>> mplib.dps = 0
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
  ValueError: non-negative integer expected


Specification
=============

The ``__setattr__`` function at the module level should accept two
arguments, the name of an attribute and the value to be assigned,
and return :py:obj:`None` or raise an :exc:`AttributeError`.

.. code:: python

   def __setattr__(name: str, value: typing.Any, /) -> None: ...

The ``__delattr__`` function should accept one argument,
the name of an attribute, and return :py:obj:`None` or raise an
:py:exc:`AttributeError`:

.. code:: python

   def __delattr__(name: str, /) -> None: ...

The ``__setattr__`` and ``__delattr__`` functions are looked up in the
module ``__dict__``.  If present, the appropriate function is called to
customize setting the attribute or its deletion, else the normal
mechanism (storing/deleting the value in the module dictionary) will work.

Defining ``__setattr__`` or ``__delattr__`` only affect lookups made
using the attribute access syntax---directly accessing the module
globals is unaffected, e.g. ``sys.modules[__name__].some_global = 'spam'``.


How to Teach This
=================

The "Customizing module attribute access" [1]_ section of the documentation
will be expanded to include new functions.


Reference Implementation
========================

The reference implementation for this PEP can be found in `CPython PR #108261
<https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/108261>`__.


Backwards compatibility
=======================

This PEP may break code that uses module level (global) names
``__setattr__`` and ``__delattr__``, but the language reference
explicitly reserves *all* undocumented dunder names, and allows
"breakage without warning" [2]_.

The performance implications of this PEP are small, since additional
dictionary lookup is much cheaper than storing/deleting the value in
the dictionary.  Also it is hard to imagine a module that expects the
user to set (and/or delete) attributes enough times to be a
performance concern.  On another hand, proposed mechanism allows to
override setting/deleting of attributes without affecting speed of
attribute access, which is much more likely scenario to get a
performance penalty.
