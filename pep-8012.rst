Abstract
========

This PEP proposes a new model of Python governance based on consensus and
voting by the Python community, without the role of a centralized singular or
a governing council.  It describes how, when, and why votes are conducted for
decisions affecting the Python language.  It also describes the criteria for
voting eligibility.

Should this model be adopted, it will be codified in PEP 13 along with the
names of all officeholders described in this PEP.
