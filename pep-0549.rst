Abstract
--------

    Python's descriptor protocol requires that descriptors
    be members of the *type* of an object.  This PEP proposes
    an extension to the descriptor protocol allowing use of
    the descriptor protocol for members of *instances.*  This
    would permit using properties in modules.

Rationale 
---------

    Python's descriptor protocol guides programmers towards
    elegant API design.  If your class supports a data-like
    member, and you *might* someday need to run code when
    changing the member's value, you're encouraged to
    simply declare it as a simple data member of the class
    for now.  If in the future you do need to run code, you
    can change it to a "property", and happily the API doesn't
    change.

    Unfortunately this doesn't work with modules.  Modules are
    instances of a single generic ``module`` type, and it's not
    feasible to modify or subclass this type to add a property
    to one's module.  This means that programmers facing this
    API design decision, where the data-like member is a singleton
    stored in a module, must preemptively add ugly "getters"
    and "setters" for the data.

    Adding support for module properties in pure Python is possible
    only by using hacks like:

      * peeking in ``sys.getframe()``,

      * changing the type of an object after it's created, or

      * replacing the object stored in ``sys.modules``.

    These techniques can be made to work, but they're fragile.

    This PEP proposes a per-type opt-in extension to the descriptor
    protocol specifically designed to enable properties in modules.
    The mechanism is a way to honor the descriptor protocol for
    members of *instances* of a class without the member being declared
    as a class variable.

    Although this is being proposed as a general mechanism, the author
    currently only forsees this as being useful for module objects.

Implementation
--------------

    The basic idea is simple: modify the ``tp_descr_get`` and ``tp_descr_set``
    functions exposed by ``PyModule_Type`` to inspect the attribute interacted
    with, and if it supports the descriptor protocol, call the relevant
    exposed function.

    Our implementation faces two challenges:

    1. Since this code will be run every time an attribute is looked up on a
       method, it needs to add very little overhead in the general case,
       where the object stored in the attribute is not a descriptor.

    2. Since functions are descriptors, we must take care to *not* honor
       the descriptor protocol for all objects.  Otherwise, all module-level
       functions will suddenly become bound to the module instance as if
       they were method calls on the module object.  The module handle would
       be passed in as a "self" argument to all module-level functions.

    Both challenges can be solved with the same approach: we define a new
    "fast subclass" flag that means "This object is a desciptor, and it
    should be honored directly when this object is looked up as an
    attribute of an instance".  So far the only placed where this flag
    is set is on ``PyProperty_Type``.

Prototype
---------

    A prototype of this functionality is under development
    at GitHub [github]_.

    Armin Rigo essentially proposed this mechanism when presented
    with the idea of "module properties", and educated the author
    both on the complexities of the problem and the proper solution.
