<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#abstract" role="doc-backlink">Abstract</a></h2>
<p>This PEP outlines the expected support for <a class="reference external" href="https://wasi.dev">WASI</a> by CPython. It contains enough
details to know what WASI and WASI SDK version is expected to be supported for
any release of CPython while official WASI support is specified in <a class="pep reference internal" href="../pep-0011/" title="PEP 11 – CPython platform support">PEP 11</a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="motivation">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#motivation" role="doc-backlink">Motivation</a></h2>
<p>CPython has supported WASI according to <a class="pep reference internal" href="../pep-0011/" title="PEP 11 – CPython platform support">PEP 11</a> since Python 3.11. As part of
this support, CPython needs to target two different things: the <a class="reference external" href="https://wasi.dev">WASI</a> version
and the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-sdk">WASI SDK</a> version (both of whose development is driven by the
<a class="reference external" href="https://bytecodealliance.org">Bytecode Alliance</a>). The former is the specification of WASI itself while the
latter is a version of <a class="reference external" href="https://clang.llvm.org">clang</a> with a specific version of <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-libc">wasi-libc</a> as the
sysroot that allows for compiling CPython to WASI. There is roughly an annual
release cadence for new WASI versions while there’s no set release cadence for
WASI SDK.</p>
<p>Agreeing on which WASI and WASI SDK versions to support allows for clear
targeting of the CPython code base towards those versions. This also lets the
community set appropriate expectations as to what will (not) be considered a
bug if it only manifests itself under a certain WASI or WASI SDK version. It
also provides the community an overall target for WASI and WASI SDK for any
specific Python version when building other software like libraries. This is
important as WASI SDK is NOT forwards- or backwards-compatible due to the ABI
of wasi-libc not making any compatibility guarantees, making broad coordination
important so code works together.</p>
<p>This coordination and recording around version targets can be important in
situations where the selected version is non-obvious. For example, WASI SDK 26
and 27 have a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-libc/issues/617">bug</a>
which cause CPython to hang in certain situations (including exiting the REPL).
Because the bug is in thread support code it wouldn’t necessarily be obvious to
others in the community that CPython will not target those versions and thus
3rd-party code should also avoid those versions.</p>
</section>
<section id="rationale">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#rationale" role="doc-backlink">Rationale</a></h2>
<p>While technically separate, CPython cannot support a version of WASI until WASI
SDK supports it. WASI versions are considered backwards-compatible with each
other, but WASI SDK is NOT compatible forwards or backwards thanks to wasi-libc
not having ABI compatibility guarantees. As such, it’s important to set support
expectations for a specific WASI SDK version in CPython. Historically, the
support difference between WASI SDK versions for CPython have involved settings
in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">config.site</span></code> file that is maintained for WASI. Support issues have
come up due to bugs in WASI SDK itself. Finally, new features being supported
by WASI SDK can also cause code that wasn’t previously used in a WASI build to
suddenly be run which can require code updates to pass tests.</p>
<p>As for WASI version support, that typically translates into what stdlib modules
are (potentially) usable with a WASI build. For example, WASI 0.2 added socket
support and WASI 0.3.1 is scheduled to have some form of threading support.
Knowing what WASI version is supported sets expectations for what stdlib
modules should be supported.</p>
<p>Interpreter feature availability can be dependent on the WASI version. For
instance, until there is threading support there can’t be free-threading
support in WASI. Once again, this helps set expectations of what should be
working based on the target WASI version.</p>
</section>
<section id="specification">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#specification" role="doc-backlink">Specification</a></h2>
<p>The WASI and WASI SDK version supported by a CPython version in CI or its
stable Buildbot builder when b1 is released MUST be the version to be supported
for the lifetime of that Python version after this PEP is accepted. If there is
a discrepancy between CI and the Buildbot builder for some reason, the WASI
maintainers as specified by <a class="pep reference internal" href="../pep-0011/" title="PEP 11 – CPython platform support">PEP 11</a> will choose which sets of versions will
be designated as the versions to support.</p>
<p>The WASI version and WASI SDK version supported for a Python version MUST be
recorded in <a class="pep reference internal" href="../pep-0011/" title="PEP 11 – CPython platform support">PEP 11</a> as an official record.</p>
<p>If for some reason a supported WASI SDK version needs to change after being
recorded, a note will be made in <a class="pep reference internal" href="../pep-0011/" title="PEP 11 – CPython platform support">PEP 11</a> as to when and why the change was
made. Such a change is at the discretion of the maintainers of WASI support as
listed in <a class="pep reference internal" href="../pep-0011/" title="PEP 11 – CPython platform support">PEP 11</a> and does not require steering council approval. The
expectation, though, is that such a change SHOULD NOT occur.</p>
<p>Changing the WASI version after it has been recorded MUST NOT occur UNLESS the
steering council approves it. This is due to the increased support burden for
new WASI versions and the shift in expectations of what CPython would support
when support expectations have already been set.</p>
<p>Any updates to <a class="pep reference internal" href="../pep-0011/" title="PEP 11 – CPython platform support">PEP 11</a> to reflect the appropriate WASI version for the target
triple for the main branch MUST be made as needed, but it does NOT require
steering council approval to update. The steering council is spared needing to
approve such an update as it does not constitute a new platform and is more in
line with a new OS release which currently does not require steering council
approval.</p>
</section>
<section id="designated-support">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#designated-support" role="doc-backlink">Designated Support</a></h2>
<p>Note that while WASI SDK in some places lists both a major and minor version,
in actuality the minor version has never been set to anything other than <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">0</span></code>
and there’s an expectation that
<a class="reference external" href="https://bytecodealliance.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/219900-wasi/topic/Platform.20tags.20for.20packages.20targeting.20WASI/near/516771862">any minor version will be ABI compatible with the overall major version</a>.
As well, the WASI community only refers to WASI SDK versions by their major
version due to there having never been a minor release. Subsequently, this PEP
only records the major version of WASI SDK until such time that there’s a need
to record a minor version.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#notes" role="doc-backlink">Notes</a></h3>
<p>All versions prior to Python 3.15 predate this PEP. The version support for
those versions is based on what was supported when this PEP was written.</p>
<p>WASI was a tier 3 platform according to <a class="pep reference internal" href="../pep-0011/" title="PEP 11 – CPython platform support">PEP 11</a> for Python 3.11 and 3.12.
WASI became a tier 2 platform starting with Python 3.13.</p>
<p>WASI 0.2 support has been skipped due to lack of time, to the point that it was
deemed better to go straight to WASI 0.3 instead. This is based on a
recommendation from the <a class="reference external" href="https://bytecodealliance.org">Bytecode Alliance</a>.</p>
<p>WASI SDK 26 and 27 have a
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-libc/issues/617">bug</a> which causes
CPython to hang in certain situations, and so they have been skipped.</p>
